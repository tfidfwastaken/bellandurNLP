{"title": "\n    Report 20/2018: Near miss at South Hampstead\n  ", "text": "At around 00:35 hrs on 11 March 2018, a group of track workers narrowly avoided being struck by a train while placing trolleys on the track alongside South Hampstead station, north London. The train was travelling at 49 mph (79 km/h) towards London Euston station when the driver saw the group, sounded his horn and applied the brake. Three other members of the work group, who were around 100 metres away from the staff placing the trolleys on the track, saw the train seconds earlier and shouted a warning to their colleagues who managed to remove the trolleys and get clear around two seconds before the train passed. One member of the group received a minor injury and many were distressed. The incident occurred because the track workers had placed the trolleys on a line which was still open to train movements, instead of on the intended adjacent line that was blocked. The RAIB investigation found that the safety arrangements that had been established were ineffective. The work group did not have anyone designated as the \u2018Person in Charge\u2019, an individual who has sufficient knowledge and competence, and is specifically appointed to manage all the risks associated with the work, including the danger from moving trains. There were also a number of unofficial working practices being used by the workgroup and the person asked to take charge of safety for the work group believed the open fast lines were the blocked slow lines. As a result of its investigation the RAIB has made six recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to: The RAIB has also identified one learning point; that those in charge of safety should be careful to check safety critical information when challenged by others in their team. clarifying to staff the exact responsibilities of a \u2018Person in Charge\u2019 making sure that managers are aware of their responsibilities improving location information that staff are provided with when working on or near the track signage at the access point at South Hampstead undertaking an audit of how Network Rail standard NR/L2/OHS/019 Issue 9 has been implemented across the network in order to determine how the standard has been interpreted and understood, and areas of good and bad practice reviewing how the changes from issue 8 to issue 9 of NR/L2/OHS/019 were managed, in order to identify any areas for improvement in the management of change."},
{"title": "\n    Report 16/2017: Track worker near miss incidents at Camden Junction South\n  ", "text": "At around 01:03 hrs on the morning of Tuesday 28 February 2017, a passenger train travelling towards London Euston station nearly struck a track worker in the vicinity of Camden Junction South. The train was travelling at about 47 mph (76 km/h) at the time and the track worker managed to get clear of the line before the train passed him. About four minutes later, the same train was involved in another near miss with a second track worker some 510 metres further up the line towards London. In this case, the track worker was unable to get clear of the line, but the train stopped just before reaching him. There was no injury or significant delay as a consequence of the incidents. The incidents occurred because the signaller authorised track workers to go onto a line over which he had just routed a train, having overlooked the fact that engineering work was taking place on that line. This was caused by a loss of information during the processes for implementing the engineering work. In turn, this was due to the layout and formatting of documentation associated with the work, as well as the nature and implementation of local processes at the signalling centre. The signaller was also possibly affected by fatigue, and the RAIB observed that, although not causal to the incidents, Network Rail\u2019s management of fatigue risk for signallers is not in accordance with current good practice. One underlying factor was associated with processes and methods for managing and communicating information regarding engineering work in modern, multi-panel signalling centres. A second was that the processes for setting up such work still require people to be present on track, exposing them to risk in the transition period before protection is fully implemented. The RAIB has made three recommendations and identified two learning points. The recommendations are all addressed to Network Rail and concern improved processes and documentation for supporting the implementation of engineering work, and reducing the exposure of track workers to risk arising from the need to be on the track. The learning points highlight the need for safety-critical staff to be appropriately prepared and fit for duty, and for track workers to be alert to the risks on the railway, even when they believe that they are working under protection. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 11/2017: Derailment and subsequent collision at Watford\n  ", "text": "Just before 07:00 hrs on Friday 16 September 2016, a London-bound passenger train operated by London Midland struck a landslip at the entrance to Watford slow lines tunnel. The leading coach of the 8-car train derailed to the right. The train came to a halt in the tunnel about 28 seconds later with the leading coach partly obstructing the opposite track. About nine seconds later, the derailed train was struck by a passenger train travelling in the opposite direction. The driver of the second train had already received a radio warning and had applied the brake, reducing the speed of impact. Both trains were damaged, but there were no serious injuries to passengers or crew. However, had the first train been derailed only a short distance further to the right the consequences would have been much more severe. The landslip occurred during a period of exceptionally wet weather. Water from adjacent land flowed into the cutting close to the tunnel portal and caused soil and rock to wash onto the track. The site had not been identified by Network Rail as being at risk of a flooding-induced landslip. Such a landslip had occurred at the same location in 1940, also causing a derailment. Drawings from the 1940s relating to a structure subsequently constructed to repair the slope were held in a Network Rail archive, but were not available to either Network Rail\u2019s asset management team or the designers of a slope protection project which was ongoing at this location at the time of the accident. As a consequence, this project made no provision for drainage. Both trains were crewed by a driver and a guard. The drivers each contacted the signaller to inform him of the accident and request the evacuation of passengers. The guards checked on their passengers to confirm that there were no casualties, and made regular announcements to keep passengers informed. The RAIB has made six recommendations. Four recommendations are addressed to Network Rail relating to the improvement of drainage, improvement in the identification of locations vulnerable to washout, access by the emergency services, and to expedite a project intended to identify all drainage assets. One recommendation is made to the Rail Delivery Group, in conjunction with RSSB, to promote a review of the circumstances when bogie or infrastructure design could provide derailment mitigation. One recommendation is made to Siemens, the manufacturer and maintainer of the trains, to address issues relating to the securing and location of emergency equipment which came loose in the driving cabs of both trains when they collided. The RAIB has also identified three learning points relating to issues identified during the investigation. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 10/2017: Partial collapse of a bridge onto open railway lines at Barrow upon Soar \n  ", "text": "At around 23:50 hrs on 1 August 2016, a bridge carrying Grove Lane in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, over the Midland Main Line, partially collapsed and a large volume of masonry fell onto the railway lines below. At the time of the collapse, core sampling work was being undertaken to investigate localised subsidence in the footpath on the south side of the bridge. The bridge was closed to the public when the collapse occurred, but the railway lines below were open to traffic. When the coring had reached about 1.4 metres below ground, water appeared at the surface and shortly afterwards, the adjacent wall fell away from the side of the bridge, taking with it part of the footpath, a length of cast iron water main and the core sampling rig. Five workers were able to get clear as the collapse occurred and no-one was injured. Two of the four railway lines through the bridge were completely obstructed and there was debris on a third.  There were no trains on the immediate approach to the bridge at the time of the collapse. The RAIB investigation found that the incident occurred because the bridge wall, built around 1840, was not designed to resist overturning. It had also been weakened by a full-\u200aheight vertical crack. The water main, which ran close to the vertical crack, probably had a slow leak which was causing on-going subsidence in the footpath. Prior to 1 August, however, there was no evidence that the wall was at risk of imminent collapse. The coring work on the night of the incident disturbed the pressurised water main and it ruptured. The consequent release of water behind the wall quickly overloaded it and caused the wall to overturn about its base. Underlying the incident was the lack of understanding of the risk posed to the structure and to the open railway from coring in proximity to the water main. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. The first relates to the competence of its staff and contractors, and the availability of information to enable them to manage the potential risk to its structures from breaches of water utilities. The second relates to the provision of appropriate engineering input to risk assessments for intrusive investigations and masonry repairs on bridges carrying water services. A further recommendation is made to Network Rail\u2019s contractor, Construction Marine Limited, about the improvement of processes relating to street works and the location of water services. The report has identified a learning point to reinforce the requirement for bridge examiners to report evidence of underground services and any changes since the previous inspection to enable a possible connection to be drawn between a water main and observations of defects on the bridge. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2017: Partial collapse of a wall onto open railway lines, Liverpool\n  ", "text": "At about 17:38 hrs on Tuesday 28 February 2017, part of a wall at the top of a cutting 20 metres above the four track railway line between Liverpool Lime Street and Edge Hill stations, collapsed. Around 170 tonnes of masonry and other debris fell into the cutting in at least two separate falls, the last of which occurred at 18:02 hrs. No trains were struck by the falling debris and there were no injuries. The overhead wires on some of the tracks were brought down and all lines were blocked by the debris. This led to severe disruption of train services. The lines were closed until 8 March 2017, during which time repairs were made to the wall, the overhead electrical supply system and the track. The investigation found that there had been developments on the leased property adjacent to the cutting, which included the addition of a soil embankment immediately behind the top of the wall. A small portion of the developed land was owned by Network Rail and was not part of the leased property. The increase in ground level caused the wall to be subjected to higher loading. Heavy rainfall may also have played a role in triggering the collapse. Information recorded by Network Rail during its routine examinations was insufficient to detect the developments on adjacent land and the infringement of its property. The investigation also found that Network Rail did not have a suitable risk prioritisation process in place for retaining walls, such as the one that collapsed, that have a high potential safety consequence in the event of a failure. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. The first relates to being aware of those of its walls which have a potentially high safety consequence in the event of failure. The second is for Network Rail to review its assessment procedures for such walls, the use of open source data to identify changes in land use, and the provision of information on property boundaries to structures examiners. This video is a 3D model created from aerial images captured on the day following the wall collapse: Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 12/2017: Dangerous train door incident at Bank station\n  ", "text": "At around 21:30 hrs on 6 February 2017, at Bank Station on the Docklands Light Railway, part of a coat worn by a passenger on the platform became trapped in the closing door of a train.  The passenger was unable to release the coat from the closed door, but managed to partially take off the coat before it was dragged from her as the train departed.  The passenger was not injured, but was distressed by the incident. The incident occurred because the part of the coat which was trapped was too small to be detected by the obstacle detection system fitted to the train door.  Additionally, the design of the door nosing rubbers meant that a relatively high pull force was required by the passenger to extract her coat.  The member of Docklands Light Railway (DLR) staff on the train was unaware that the coat was trapped.  His position when dispatching the train meant that he was dependent on a CCTV system to observe the doors during the dispatch, but defects in this CCTV system meant that the staff member was unable to observe the door of the train at which the incident occurred. As a result of this investigation, the RAIB has made three recommendations.  One recommendation is made to Keolis Amey Docklands, in conjunction with Docklands Light Railway Limited, to review the design of door nosing rubbers with a view to reducing the forces needed to remove trapped objects.  The second recommendation, made to Docklands Light Railway Limited, seeks that their specification for new trains to be procured gives adequate consideration to the safety learning from this investigation in relation to pull-out forces.  The third recommendation is also made to Keolis Amey Docklands; this is to improve its processes for the management of platform observation equipment. The RAIB has also repeated a learning point for staff responsible for the dispatching of trains; that door obstacle detection systems are not always able to detect small objects and therefore it is vital that a final, visual, safety check is made to ensure that no object is trapped in a closed door prior to a train being allowed to depart from a station. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 14/2017: Fatal accident at Alice Holt footpath crossing, Hampshire\n  ", "text": "At 16:20 hours on Wednesday 5 October 2016 a mobility scooter was struck by a train, and the scooter user fatally injured, at Alice Holt footpath crossing, Bentley, Hampshire. Users of Alice Holt footpath crossing are required to look and listen for approaching trains before deciding whether it is safe to cross the line.  It is uncertain why the user decided to cross when it was unsafe to do so, as CCTV images suggest that he had previously crossed in a safe manner.  It is probable that the user did not see the train or misjudged when it would arrive at the crossing, perhaps due to sun glare, when deciding to cross.  The mobility scooter user\u2019s opportunity to see the approaching train was limited by the design of Alice Holt crossing, in particular the fencing.  The mobility scooter user did not react to the train\u2019s horn, possibly because he did not hear it. The RAIB has found that Network Rail\u2019s guidance for level crossing managers did not include any advice concerning use by mobility scooter users and the management of the crossing had not allowed for vulnerable users such as these. The RAIB has addressed one recommendation to Network Rail.  This seeks modification of Network Rail\u2019s level crossing management processes so that they consider mobility scooter use at all crossings which rely on users looking and listening for trains. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 13/2017: Fatal collision at Woodbourn Road, Sheffield\n  ", "text": "At 10:02 hrs on 22 December 2016, a pedestrian, who had just got off an inbound tram at Woodbourn Road tram stop, was struck and fatally injured by an outbound tram travelling from Sheffield city centre towards Meadowhall. The pedestrian was using the crossing at the northern end of the tram stop at the time. The crossing, which runs over both tracks, provides a pathway between the inbound platform and Woodbourn Road. No one was waiting at the outbound platform and no one on board the outbound tram had requested that it stop, so it was travelling non-stop through the platform at around 13 mph (21 km/h). The tram driver did not see the pedestrian approaching the crossing. Until shortly before the collision, the tram driver\u2019s attention was focused on looking in the tram\u2019s mirrors and not on looking ahead. Consequently, the driver did not see the pedestrian in time to take action to prevent the accident. Other possible factors that might have contributed to the accident were that the driver was wearing sunglasses, which might have reduced the visibility of the pedestrian who was in a shaded area, and the driver\u2019s concentration level might have been reduced by that stage of the journey. The pedestrian was seemingly unaware that the tram was approaching the crossing and the tram did not give an audible warning to indicate that it was passing non-stop through the tram stop. An underlying cause was that Stagecoach Supertram had not assessed the risk of trams in service running non-stop through tram stops when it first introduced the system of request stops around 1999. The RAIB also found inconsistencies between the training and assessments for new tram drivers when making non-stop movements through tram stops and the operational standards that drivers are required to follow for such movements. Since the accident, Stagecoach Supertram has reported it has taken action to mandate audible warnings for all non-stop movements through tram stops and to reduce driver distraction due to looking in mirrors. It has also updated its risk assessment to include trams in service running non-stop through tram stops and implemented measures to reduce the risk of collisions with pedestrians. These reported actions address factors which otherwise would have resulted in RAIB recommendations. The RAIB has made two recommendations. One recommendation is addressed to Stagecoach Supertram and relates to the continuance of its work to review its training material against its operational standards so that they are made consistent. The second recommendation is addressed to UK tram operators, in conjunction with UK Tram Limited, and relates to setting up an industry working group to monitor the development and application of new pedestrian detection technology to alert drivers to potential collisions with pedestrians. The RAIB has also identified three learning points. The first highlights the importance of tram operators actively assessing and managing the additional risk to users of foot crossings associated with trams making non-stop movements through tram stops. The second reminds tram drivers to only use driving mirrors for essential tasks related to the safe operation of the tram during non-stop movements through tram stops. The third is for tram drivers about understanding how sunglasses can affect their vision when passing from sunlit to shaded areas, particularly during the winter months when the sun is low. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 15/2017: Serious irregularity at Cardiff East Junction\n  ", "text": "Over the Christmas and New Year period from 24 December 2016 to 2 January 2017, Network Rail carried out extensive resignalling and track remodelling work in and around Cardiff Central station. This was the final stage of the Cardiff area signalling renewal scheme, a project which has been in progress for several years. This stage involved the closure of the power signal box at Cardiff, with control of the signalling in the area moving to the Wales Railway Operating Centre (WROC), and changes to the track layout and signalling on the east side of Cardiff Central station. Some of the new layout was brought into use on 29 December. At 08:37 hrs on that day, the driver of a train from Cardiff Central to Treherbert, which had just left platform 7, noticed that points in the route his train was about to take were not set in the correct position, and stopped the train just before reaching them. The points at which the train stopped were redundant in the new layout, and should have been secured in readiness for their complete removal at a later date. The project works required eight sets of points in two separate locations to be secured. In the event only six of the eight points were secured, and the line was re-opened to traffic without the omission having been identified by the testing team through the normal checking processes which should take place as part of this type of work. The two sets of points which were missed were left in a condition in which they were unsecured and not detected by the signalling system, and the points at which the train stopped were set for the diverging route. If the driver had not noticed the position of these points and stopped, the train would have been diverted on to a line which was open to traffic, on which trains can run in either direction, and on which another train passed over about three minutes after the train involved in the incident came to a stop. The new signalling system uses axle counters for train detection, and in this situation the system would not have immediately identified that the train was in the wrong place. The points had been left in this unsafe condition because they had not been identified as requiring securing by the team securing points during the works. Furthermore, no one had checked that all the points that needed to be secured during the works over the Christmas period had been. Route proving trains, a performance and reliability tool used to ensure the system was working correctly before running passenger services, had been cancelled. The investigation also found that a work group culture had developed between long standing members of the project team that led to insular thinking about methods of work and operational risk. This meant that team members relied on verbal communications and assurances. An underlying factor was insufficiently thorough project governance and a possible underlying factor was ineffective fatigue management. In this case, no-one was injured and no damage was caused by the event, and Network Rail acted quickly to secure both sets of points. RAIB has identified four learning points and made three recommendations. The learning points relate to the need for testers in charge to be able to confirm that all redundant wiring and equipment has been checked; the need for each intermediate state in which the railway is to operate before completion of the scheme to have an up to date and correct signalling scheme plan reflecting the true state of the layout; the need to mitigate the effect of cancelling route proving trains at the end of commissioning works; and the need to carefully consider the value and purpose of team briefings relating to large scale works to avoid people being overloaded with superfluous information. Three recommendations have been made, all directed to Network Rail. The first relates to the need for good project governance to ensure a project complies with guidance, procedures and processes to enable the railway to be handed back after works are completed in a safe state in order to resume operational service. The second is concerned with document management systems, and the third recommendation deals with fatigue management for people working on projects and commissioning, recognising that fatigue in the workplace needs to be managed and mitigated, not just the risk of workers suffering fatigue while travelling to and from their place of work. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 18/2017: Overturning of a tram at Sandilands junction, Croydon\n  ", "text": "On the morning of 9 November 2016, tram 2551 reached the maximum permitted speed of 80 km/h as it entered the first of three closely spaced tunnels, which together extended for about 500 metres. When leaving the tunnels, the tram should have been reducing speed significantly as it was approaching the sharp curve round to Sandilands junction, where there is a 20 km/h limit. This was marked by a speed limit sign at the start of the curve. On the day of the accident, the tram was travelling at 73 kilometres per hour when it reached this sign. The excessive speed caused the tram to overturn as it passed through the curve. Passengers were thrown around inside the tram and the tram slid along the ground on its side. Of the 69 passengers involved in this tragic accident, seven died and 61 were injured, 19 seriously. Investigation methods included: The RAIB\u2019s investigation concluded that it is probable that the driver temporarily lost awareness on a section of route on which his workload was low. The investigation has found that a possible explanation for this loss of awareness was that the driver had a microsleep, and that this was linked to fatigue.  Although it is possible that the driver was fatigued due to insufficient sleep there is no evidence that this was the result of the shift pattern that he was required to work. It is also possible that, as he regained awareness, the driver became confused about his location and direction of travel through the tunnels. The infrastructure did not contain sufficiently distinctive features to alert tram drivers that they were approaching the tight curve. The investigation found that: The RAIB has made 15 recommendations intended to improve safety. Recommendation areas include: Video summary and animation Overturning of a tram at Sandilands junction, Croydon Animated recreation of Sandilands derailment [Microsleep - Unintentional periods of sleep lasting anywhere from a fraction of a second to a few minutes.

{"title": "\n    Report 09/2017: Fatal accident, Balham\n  ", "text": "At about 17:24 hrs on Sunday 7 August 2016 a passenger, travelling on a Gatwick Express service from Gatwick Airport to London Victoria, suffered fatal injuries as a result of having his head out of a window and striking it on a signal gantry near Balham in south London. The train was travelling at about 61 mph (98 km/h) at the time of the accident. The window concerned was on a door opposite a guard\u2019s compartment in the train; this door was accessible to passengers but it was not intended for passenger use. The RAIB has found no evidence to explain why the passenger put his head out of the window at that time. The accident occurred because the passenger\u2019s head was out of the window, there was nothing to prevent passengers from opening the window or putting their head out of the opened window, and because there was less than the normal standard clearance between the train and the signal gantry. Although the clearance was compliant with standards for existing structures, it was less than an industry recommended minimum for new structures where there are trains with opening passenger windows. An underlying cause was that the process for assessing the compatibility of this train on this route did not identify the risk of the combination of reduced structure clearances and opening windows. The RAIB has made two recommendations and identified one learning point.  One recommendation is addressed to Network Rail, and seeks to improve the industry\u2019s management of the interacting risks between infrastructure and rolling stock.  The second recommendation is addressed to relevant train operators with the intention of reducing the risk from people leaning out of opening train windows. The learning point reinforces the need for regular monitoring and management of structure clearances when those clearances are reduced from normal.

{"title": "\n    Report 19/2017: Freight train derailment at East Somerset Junction\n  ", "text": "At about 17:49 hrs on Monday 20 March 2017, six wagons of a freight train carrying aggregates from Merehead Quarry to Acton Yard derailed at East Somerset Junction, between Westbury and Castle Cary. The accident blocked the Up Westbury line, and the train stopped when the brakes applied automatically following the parting of a coupling. There were no injuries. The derailment occurred due to a loss of track integrity: the fixity of the right-hand rail was lost due to progressive failure of the chairscrews under the loads from freight trains traversing the curve, leading to gauge spread. The investigation identified that the design of the track was sub-optimal, following replacement of a set of points with plain line in 2010. The signs of gauge spread were not identified during inspections of the track by staff from Westbury track maintenance depot, and the section of line where the derailment occurred had not been subject to mandatory geometry measurements. The RAIB has made four recommendations addressed to Network Rail. These cover enhancements to the company\u2019s procedures for plain-lining of points, mitigation of risk at locations where points have previously been plain-lined, improvements to planning the operation of track measurement trains and evaluating the delivery of key track maintenance activities in the Westbury area. The RAIB has also made a learning point, reinforcing the importance of identifying gauge spread on sections of curved track which may be subject to high lateral loads."},
{"title": "\n    Report 01/2018: Runaway of a maintenance train near Markinch\n  ", "text": "At about 04:25 hrs on Tuesday 17 October 2017, a maintenance train that was clearing leaf debris from the track, hit a tree just north of Markinch station, Fife. The debris from the tree disabled the train\u2019s braking system. The train came to a stop before running away backwards for a distance of about 4.7 miles (7.5 km). The train crew on board made an emergency call to the signaller before jumping off the train, suffering minor injuries. The train eventually came to a stop at Thornton North junction after running backwards and forwards between two adjacent gradients a total of nine times. The brakes were fully released when debris from the tree operated the release mechanisms on the brake system distributors underneath both of the vehicles in the train. The driver was unable to reapply the brakes because the debris from the tree had also separated all three of the brake pipes between the two vehicles in the train. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. The first addresses the risk of a runaway being initiated by debris on the track causing multiple disruptions to the braking system on this type of train. The second recommendation addresses the possibility that similar risks might be present for other short formation trains that operate on its infrastructure.

{"title": "\n    Report 02/2018: Child nearly falling through a missing toilet floor, South Devon Railway\n  ", "text": "At around 13:15 hrs on Thursday 22 June 2017, a mother and her three-year-old child were travelling on a South Devon Railway train from Totnes (Riverside) to Buckfastleigh. Shortly after leaving Staverton station, while the train was travelling at about 20 mph (32 km/h), the child left his seat and went towards a toilet on the train, followed by his mother walking a short distance behind. The child entered the toilet, and as the door opened and the child stepped through it, he fell forward because the floor was missing in the compartment he had entered. A more serious accident was only prevented by the quick reaction of the mother who grabbed the child\u2019s arm and prevented him falling through the opening and onto the track below. The child suffered minor bruising, and both mother and child were shocked. The accident was reported immediately to the railway company, but the RAIB was not advised of what had happened until 25 June 2017. In April 2017 the South Devon Railway had carried out a repair to this carriage. The location of the repair was difficult to gain access to and required the floor of the toilet cubicle to be removed. The railway\u2019s management decided that the door would be secured and notices placed on the door, allowing the carriage to enter service with the toilet floor missing. The RAIB found that the method of securing the door was inadequate, so that over time the door became less secure to the extent it was possible for the child to open it. The risk associated with the absence of the toilet floor was not sufficiently appreciated nor adequately managed after the carriage was allowed to enter service. The RAIB also found that the South Devon Railway had no formal competence management assessment for staff involved in carriage maintenance. Both of these factors led to no-one detecting that the door had become unsecure. The RAIB observed during the investigation that the South Devon Railway\u2019s maintenance regime did not identify the extent of the deteriorating condition of the carriage structure, and the railway\u2019s fitness to run process was not being correctly applied. The RAIB has made one recommendation to the South Devon Railway to commission an independent review of the actions it has taken since the accident to address the deficiencies in its processes. The RAIB believes that the investigation has also identified an important lesson likely to be applicable to other heritage railways, about applying appropriate standards for vehicle maintenance, to ensure that the examination regime which they have in place will identify the foreseeable deterioration of vehicles, before it reaches a stage that may affect safety. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses"},
{"title": "\n    Report 03/2018: Trailer runaway near Hope, Derbyshire\n  ", "text": "At around 06:30 hrs on Sunday 28 May 2017, a trailer, being propelled by a small rail tractor between Edale and Bamford, became detached and ran away for a distance of around 1 mile (1.6 km). It came to a stop at a set of points at Earles Sidings, near Hope. There were no injuries that required medical attention, and there was no significant damage to the infrastructure, the trailer or the tractor. The tractor and trailer became separated because the towbar pin fell out. A linch pin that secured the towbar pin had almost certainly been inserted in the wrong orientation. This would have resulted in it falling out, allowing the towbar pin to fall out and the towbar to become uncoupled. The subsequent runaway occurred because the brakes on the trailer had been manually disabled by the staff present, to overcome them being stuck in the applied position. It is likely that this was because the hydraulic brake hose between the tractor and the trailer had either been not connected or incorrectly connected at the start of the shift. The RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail as a result of this investigation. One relates to providing staff with guidance on what actions to take if a trailer becomes immobilised when being used. The second relates to management of staff competence at the depot involved in the incident. The third relates to learning lessons from multiple non-compliances during use of the plant. The RAIB has also identified two learning points, relating to the precautions required when isolating trailer brakes and to the requirements to carry out a full set of brake tests prior to use. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 04/2018: Freight train derailment at Lewisham\n  ", "text": "At about 05:30 hrs on 24 January 2017 two wagons within an aggregate train derailed on newly-laid track at Courthill Loop South Junction in Lewisham, south-east London.  The first of the wagons ran derailed, damaging the track, then overturned spilling its payload of sand.  There was major disruption to rail services while the wagons were recovered and the infrastructure reinstated.  No-one was injured. The new track had been installed during renewal work on the weekend of 14 and 15 January 2017.  It was made up of separate panels of switch and crossing track, comprising the rails, point and crossing components and the supporting concrete bearers.  Most of these track panels had been brought to site pre-assembled.  A mechanical connector, known as a \u2018bearer tie\u2019, was used to join the concrete bearers that were designed to support rails on more than one panel.  Network Rail originally developed the concept for this type of track in the mid-2000s; it is referred to as \u2018modular S&C\u2019. Planned follow-up engineering work was undertaken on the subsequent weekend.  The derailment happened on the day after hand-back checks on completion of this work had confirmed that the track geometry was suitable for the passage of trains.  It occurred because the first of the two derailed wagons, which was probably carrying an uneven payload, encountered a significant track twist, resulting in there being insufficient wheel load at the leading left-hand wheel to prevent its flange climbing over the rail head. The track twist had developed rapidly following the hand-back because: Network Rail\u2019s engineering processes for specifying and developing modular S&C layouts were an underlying factor, in that they were inadequate for controlling the risks associated with flange climb derailment. The RAIB has made five recommendations: Four are directed to Network Rail, concerned with: One is directed to RSSB concerned with understanding and managing the derailment risks associated with uneven loading of bulk hopper wagons The RAIB has additionally identified learning points concerning the management and planning of track installation work, and procedures for the routine maintenance of railway vehicles. Response to recommendations: the support offered by the track bed to the concrete bearers was poor the inherent flexibility of the bearer ties located between the two running rails made one side of the track more susceptible to the poor track bed support than the other. \n     \n\n     the processes it uses to identify and manage risks associated with vertical track geometry features following track renewal and heavy maintenance the design and validation of its modular S&C layouts \n   \n     \n   RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses"},

The train was formed of a four-car class 317 electric multiple unit and was being driven at the time by a trainee driver under the supervision of a driver instructor. The train came into the platform at normal speed, but the brakes were not applied so as to bring the train to a stand before the collision with the buffer stops occurred. At the time of the collision, the train was travelling at around 7.5 mph (12 km/h). Upon contact with the buffers, the train stopped rapidly, with the buffer stops moving back a short distance. Fourteen passengers reported injuries: of those, four were treated by the London Ambulance Service and two were taken to hospital. Both were released later the same day. There was minor damage caused to the buffer stops and the outside of the train. A small number of interior fittings were dislodged during the impact and at least one passenger was struck by a detached lighting diffuser as it fell from the ceiling of the train. The accident occurred because the trainee driver did not apply the brakes in time. The driver instructor told the trainee when the brakes needed to be applied, but the trainee selected the wrong control handle. He may have been distracted by seeing a person on the platform, and because he was still at an early stage of his practical training, he had not yet acquired instinctive competence in the selection of the correct control. The driver instructor was very experienced, but he had not been trained to teach, and his employer\u2019s monitoring and assessment of his work as an instructor had not identified any deficiency in his ability to teach. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made two recommendations to the train operator, Govia Thameslink Railway. The first covers possible ways of minimising the risk from mistakes made by inexperienced trainee train drivers. The second relates to improvements to the way the company trains and manages driver instructors. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2016: Collision between two trams at Shalesmoor\n  ", "text": "At 08:25 hrs on 22 October 2015, Sheffield Supertram 120 collided with tram 118 which was stationary in the tram stop at Shalesmoor. A number of passengers and a member of staff received minor injuries, and the tramway through Shalesmoor was closed for the remainder of the day. The collision occurred in conditions of low rail head adhesion on the approach to Shalesmoor tram stop at the time. Tram 120 was not being driven in a manner appropriate for the conditions, and its brakes did not provide the level of braking the driver expected. An additional factor was that at the time, tram 118 was at the tram stop and had not been able to depart prior to the collision because it was blocked by road traffic queuing at a yellow box junction ahead. As a result of this investigation, RAIB has made one recommendation for UK tram operators relating to reviewing and where necessary improving, their processes for managing the risks from low adhesion conditions. RAIB has also identified one key learning point relating to the performance of magnetic track brakes when the rail head has low adhesion. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 18/2016: Two signal passed at danger incidents at Reading Westbury Line Junction and Ruscombe Junction\n  ", "text": "At 08:22 hrs on 28 March 2015, a freight train running from Acton to Westbury, operated by DB Schenker Rail (UK), passed a signal at danger at Reading Westbury Line Junction, to the west of Reading station. A similar incident occurred at 06:11 hrs on 3 November 2015 when another freight train forming the same service from Acton to Westbury, and operated by the same company, passed a signal at danger at Ruscombe Junction, about seven miles east of Reading. RAIB began an investigation into both of these incidents following the latter event at Ruscombe Junction, owing to the similarities between them. Both incidents occurred because the train drivers involved were too fatigued to properly control their trains; both drivers stated that they momentarily fell asleep on the approach to the signals concerned.  They were suffering from fatigue because they had not obtained sufficient sleep, which in part was due to the rest facilities at Acton not being fit for purpose, and because the drivers were nearing the end of a long night shift.  Neither driver reported as unfit for duty, which was also causal to the incidents.  The investigation identified underlying factors associated with supervision and management at the drivers\u2019 home depot in Westbury, and with the general approach to the management of fatigue within the company. As a result of this investigation, RAIB has made three recommendations covering shift planning at Westbury depot, fatigue management within the freight sector and identification of fatigue risk through data analysis. RAIB has also identified two learning points concerning the importance of preparing for duty and reporting fatigue, and the role of napping (and facilities for such) within a fatigue risk management system.

{"title": "\n    Report 20/2016: Collision at Knockmore Junction\n  ", "text": "At around 06:53 hrs on 4 February 2016, the 06:25 hrs passenger train from Belfast Great Victoria Street to Portadown collided with an excavator bucket. This had been left on the track near Knockmore Junction, about 1.25 miles (2 km) from Lisburn Station. The train hit the bucket at a speed of 57 mph (92 km/h) and then travelled 330 metres in an upright position before stopping. There were no significant injuries to the people on the train, but the leading vehicle was badly damaged and the track required repair. The bucket had been detached from an excavator machine undertaking track maintenance work during the previous night when regular train services were not running. The machine driver had forgotten about the bucket. The track safety co-ordinator had not remained near the machine, as required by the rule book, and so was unaware that the bucket had been detached. Other members of the work group had not noticed that it remained on the track as they removed other equipment in darkness. There was no effective process for checking that the track was clear of obstructions before the line was reopened to regular services. The work group was working within a worksite to which access was being controlled by an engineering supervisor. Although not a factor in the accident, the track safety co-ordinator and engineering supervisor had arranged this access using an informal method that did not meet the rule book requirements. As a result of this accident, RAIB has made two recommendations addressed to Northern Ireland Railways. The first seeks a formalised process for checking that lines are safe after engineering work is complete and before the line is reopened to regular traffic. The second seeks a review and possible modifications to the formalised communication arrangements used by engineering supervisors controlling access to the railway. RAIB has also identified three learning points relating to track safety co-ordinators always remaining with their work groups, minimising risks due to objects capable of endangering trains being placed on the line and compliance with formalised arrangements for controlling access to worksites. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 19/2016: Overspeed incident at Queen\u2019s Park\n  ", "text": "At 08:28 hrs on 5 January 2016, a London Midland train estimated to be carrying around 2000 passengers travelled at 75 mph (121 km/h) through a 5 mph (8 km/h) emergency speed restriction at Queen\u2019s Park in north-west London. The train was the 07:39 hrs service from Bletchley to London Euston and was being driven by a driver manager who was being assessed by another driver manager. The emergency speed restriction had been imposed due to a track defect. There were no injuries, no further damage to the infrastructure and no damage to the train which continued its journey to Euston. The driver manager who was being assessed did not slow the train for the emergency speed restriction as he had misunderstood details of the restriction given in an email. Details of the restriction were also given on a notice displayed at his booking-on point, and lineside warnings were provided on the approach to the restriction. These did not correct the driver\u2019s misunderstanding. The assessing driver manager\u2019s knowledge of the emergency speed restriction was insufficient to notice the driver\u2019s error. The RAIB has made three recommendations to London Midland seeking to improve the ongoing training of driver managers, improve the communication of safety critical information and to implement a means of quickly identifying the driver of any train. The RAIB has also identified three learning points concerning the importance of managers fully preparing before driving trains, the need for driving assessors to prepare as if they were driving the train and the use of unambiguous words in safety communications.

{"title": "\n    Report 21/2016: Collision at Barrow-upon-Soar\n  ", "text": "At around 10:26 hrs on 14 February 2016, a passenger train collided with a conveyor boom projecting from an aggregates train standing in sidings at Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire.  The train was travelling at approximately 102 mph (163 km/h). Two of the coaches of the train were damaged by the impact but the train did not derail. The unloading wagon conveyor boom was also damaged.  A fitter, who had been working on the conveyor, was seriously injured.  Nobody on the train was injured. The wagon involved in the accident was part of a train which had been loaded with aggregates ready for departure the following day.  While checking the operation of one of the wagons in the train, the fitter identified that it needed maintenance. During the maintenance activity a subsequent failure occurred in the control circuit; a push button switch controlling the movement of the boom became stuck in the \u2018on\u2019 position.  This caused the boom to fully rotate and, because of the location of the siding in which the maintenance was being undertaken, this placed the end of the boom foul of the nearest of the main lines.  There was no instruction to prevent the wagon being maintained on this siding.  The risk assessments undertaken in support of the systems of work adopted a\nat the site had not considered the risk of the boom moving out of control and affecting other train operations. It is probable that the contact block of the push button switch became stuck due to corrosion deposit obstructing its moving parts.  This was most likely due to the contact block being exposed to environmental conditions for which it was not designed. The underlying causes of the accident related to the maintenance of the electrical system of the wagon, and the management of the associated safety risk. As a result of this investigation, RAIB has made four recommendations relating to: Three learning points are also noted relating to the responsibilities of Entities in Charge of Maintenance and vehicle registration holders. Response to recommendations: Tarmac\u2019s (the owner of the wagon) and Wabtec\u2019s (the maintainer) processes for hazard identification and risk assessment Wabtec\u2019s management arrangements and procedures at Barrow-upon-Soar Tarmac\u2019s processes for determining when it is necessary to implement interim safety measures after it becomes aware of deficiencies in the condition of its wagons Restoring the condition of the wagon\u2019s electrical system, should the wagon re-enter service.

{"title": "\n    Report 22/2016: Structural failure at Lamington viaduct\n  ", "text": "At 08:40 hrs on Thursday 31 December 2015, subsidence of Lamington viaduct resulted in serious deformation of the track as the 05:57 hrs Crewe to Glasgow passenger service passed over at a speed of about 110 mph (177 km/h). The viaduct spans the River Clyde between Lockerbie and Carstairs. Subsequent investigation showed that the viaduct\u2019s central river pier had been partially undermined by scour following high river flow velocity the previous day. The line was closed for over seven weeks until Monday 22 February 2016 while emergency stabilisation works were completed. The driver of an earlier train had reported a track defect on the viaduct at 07:28 hrs on the same morning, and following trains crossed the viaduct at low speed while a Network Rail track maintenance team was deployed to the site. The team found no significant track defects and normal running was resumed with the 05:57 hrs service being the first train to pass on the down line. Immediately after this occurred at 08:40 hrs, large track movements were noticed by the team, who immediately imposed an emergency speed restriction before closing the line after finding that the central pier was damaged. The viaduct spans a river bend which causes water to wash against the sides of the piers. It was also known to have shallow foundations. These were among the factors that resulted in it being identified as being at high risk of scour in 2005. A scheme to provide permanent scour protection to the piers and abutments was due to be constructed during 2015, but this project was deferred until mid-2016 because a necessary environmental approval had not been obtained. To mitigate the risk of scour, the viaduct was included on a list of vulnerable bridges for which special precautions were required during flood conditions. These precautions included monitoring of river levels and closing the line if a pre determined water level was exceeded. However, this process was no longer in use and there was no effective scour risk mitigation for over 100 of the most vulnerable structures across Scotland. This had occurred, in part, because organisational changes within Network Rail had led to the loss of knowledge and ownership of some structures issues. Although unrelated to the incident, the RAIB found that defects in the central river pier had not been fully addressed by planned maintenance work. There was also no datum level marked on the structure which meant that survey information from different sources could not easily be compared to identify change. As a result of this investigation, RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail relating to: Five learning points are also noted relating to effective management of scour risk. Response to recommendations: the management of scour risk the response to defect reports affecting structures over water the management of control centre procedures. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 16/2016: Derailment at Knaresborough \n  ", "text": "At 07:22 hrs on 7 November 2015, a Northern Rail passenger service from York to Harrogate derailed on a set of points on the approach to Knaresborough station. The train consisted of two class 150, 2-car multiple units. The leading five bogies derailed and damage was sustained by both the train and track. None of the train crew or five passengers on board were injured. The line was re-opened at 12:58 hrs on 8 November 2015. The signaller in Knaresborough signal box had authorised the train to pass a signal at danger (red), without realising that the set of points beyond the signal was in an unsafe condition. The signaller had not checked the associated points position indicator in the signal box and misinterpreted the significance of being able to reverse the signal lever, leading him to believe that the route was correctly set and safe. The signaller that day was a mobile operations manager. As a mobile operations manager, his core work was to respond to faults and incidents on the railway network; he operated signal boxes infrequently. The RAIB concluded that the signaller did not have a full understanding of the working of Knaresborough signal box and that this lack of knowledge may have been the result of either poor initial training or the way his knowledge had been maintained. An underlying factor to this incident was the lack of robustness of Network Rail\u2019s competence management system for non-signallers (the people within Network Rail whose core duty is not to operate signal boxes but who occasionally have to do so). In March 2016, Network Rail re-issued the operations manual for the staff in charge of operating signalling equipment. In April 2016, Network Rail started an end-to-end review of the way it manages the competence of its signallers. As a result of this investigation, RAIB has made one recommendation on Network Rail to review whether the changes that it has recently made to the operations manual have resulted in non-signallers maintaining the required level of knowledge and experience. RAIB has identified five learning points. The first three learning points relate to the actions of signallers in degraded operating conditions. The fourth learning point relates to the importance of investigating and understanding the underlying reasons for repeated asset failures. The final learning point relates to the actions of drivers when authorised to pass a signal at danger and after an incident.

{"title": "\n    Report 23/2016: Fatal accident at Grimston Lane level crossing\n  ", "text": "At 12:19 hrs on Tuesday 23 February 2016, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Grimston Lane footpath level crossing in Trimley St Martin, Suffolk. The train was travelling from Ipswich to Felixstowe. The driver sounded the train\u2019s warning horn soon after first seeing the pedestrian. The pedestrian raised his arm in apparent acknowledgment of the horn and continued to cross in front of the train. It is not possible to be certain why the pedestrian started to cross the railway when he had insufficient time to do so. The RAIB has concluded that he was either unaware of the train at the time he decided to cross, or that he misjudged the time he needed. He may have been unaware of the train because he did not look, possibly as a result of the skewed alignment of the crossing. On the other hand, it is possible that he was not in the best position to see the train when he made his decision to cross. He may have misjudged the time he needed because he overestimated the time it would take for the train to arrive at the crossing, or he underestimated how long it would take him to cross. The age and health of the pedestrian meant that he fell into the category of people considered, by Network Rail\u2019s guidance, to be \u2018vulnerable users\u2019. Network Rail\u2019s assessment of the user group for the crossing did not identify the need to make an additional time allowance for vulnerable users at the crossing. However, as the sighting time for approaching trains was sufficient even if such an allowance had been made, this was not causal to the accident. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. One relates to the importance of understanding and managing the effects of skewed alignment on the use of level crossings. The second relates to reducing the risk to vulnerable level crossing users in an expedient manner, as it upgrades passive crossings. Additionally, the RAIB identified a learning point relating to the implementation of findings from recent RSSB research into encouraging pedestrians to make better crossing decisions.

{"title": "\n    Report 24/2016: Derailment at Ealing Broadway\n  ", "text": "At 01:29 hrs on 2 March 2016, the leading bogie of a London Underground District line train derailed just outside Ealing Broadway station. The train was travelling at less than 5 mph (8 km/h) when it derailed. There were 19 passengers and two members of staff on board the train at the time of the accident. There were no injuries. The train had been held at a red signal since 00:35 hrs as a result of a track circuit failure. During that time, staff had been establishing which points needed to be secured in order for the train to safely pass the signal at danger and proceed to Ealing Broadway platform 7, where it could terminate. Due to the inadequate level of information available to the service control staff, the poor relationship between the two control rooms involved, and a lack of understanding of the way in which the type of points involved were shown on the various available diagrams, the operational control staff did not identify the correct positions of all the sets of points that needed to be secured in the route. Consequently, the train was authorised to pass the signal at danger with a set of points in the wrong position for the route the train was due to follow. The service control staff were not completely clear, from the information available to them within the control rooms, which points they needed to set in which positions and so they asked the maintenance team for assistance. The two teams did not communicate effectively and did not reach a complete understanding of the requirements for the route. The RAIB has made three recommendations to London Underground Limited. The first covers possible ways of improving the quality and amount of information provided to control room staff to help them make decisions. The second relates to ensuring that a complete and full understanding is reached when passing messages, and ensuring that all those who may need to provide information for operational purposes are appropriately trained; and the third involves ensuring control room staff are able to respond appropriately in the event of conflict or confusion, to enhance team working and effective decision making. The RAIB has also identified two learning points, relating to the importance of having proper arrangements for safety in place if work needs to be done near live electrical conductors, and avoiding confusion when passing messages by keeping the chain of communication short. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 01/2017: Occupied wheelchair contacting passing train, Twyford\n  ", "text": "At around 10:52 hrs on 7 April 2016, a wheelchair occupied by a teenage girl moved towards the edge of platform 4 at Twyford station and came into multiple glancing contacts with the wagons of a passing freight train. The last contact pushed the wheelchair clear of the platform edge. The girl suffered a minor injury to her foot. Prior to the accident, the girl and her mother were waiting to catch a train on the platform. The wheelchair was stationary, behind the yellow line painted on the platform, and with the wheels parallel to the railway tracks. It was positioned next to the girl\u2019s mother, who had applied the brakes. The accident occurred because the freight train\u2019s slipstream, combined with the ambient wind, generated an aerodynamic force which was able to overcome the brakes on the wheelchair. The mother was unaware that the freight train posed a hazard to the wheelchair, and therefore did not take any additional precautions beyond applying the brakes. As a result of the investigation, the RAIB has made five recommendations. One recommendation is made to the Rail Delivery Group to inform the public of the potential hazards from train slipstreams and the need to apply brakes and keep a hold of wheelchairs and pushchairs when non-stopping trains pass through stations. Two recommendations are made to RSSB; one to investigate measures to improve the safety of wheelchair and pushchair users at railway stations, and the second to change the Railway Group Standard which specifies when a station operator must carry out a formal assessment of the risks from passing trains. Two recommendations are also made to Great Western Railway, to continue its current work to risk-assess the platforms for which it is responsible, and to ensure that warnings of passing trains provided to station users are timely and effective. The RAIB has also identified a learning point for members of the public: that trains passing through platforms, particularly freight trains, can generate powerful slipstreams sufficient to move a wheelchair or pushchair against its brakes. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 14/2016: Overspeed at Fletton Junction\n  ", "text": "At around 17:11 hrs on 11 September 2015, the 14:25 hrs Virgin Trains East Coast passenger train service from Newcastle to London King\u2019s Cross passed through Fletton Junction, near Peterborough at 51 mph (82 km/h) around twice the permitted speed of 25 mph (40 km/h). This caused the carriages to lurch sideways resulting in minor injuries to three members of staff and one passenger. It is likely that the train driver had forgotten about the presence of the speed restriction because he was distracted and fatigued due to issues related to his family. Lineside signs and in-cab warnings may have contributed to him not responding appropriately as he approached the speed restriction and engineering controls did not prevent the overspeeding. Neither Virgin Trains East Coast, nor the driver, had realised that family-related distraction and fatigue were likely to be affecting the safety of his driving.  Virgin Trains East Coast route risk assessment had not recognised the overspeeding risks particular to Fletton Junction and Network Rail had not identified that a speed limit sign at the start of the speed restriction was smaller than required by its standards. The incident could have had more serious consequences if the train had derailed or overturned. The risk of this was present because the track layout was designed for a maximum speed of 27 mph (43 km/h). As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made five recommendations. Two addressed to Virgin Trains East Coast relate to enhancing the management of safety critical staff with problems related to their home life, and considering such issues during the investigation of unsafe events. A recommendation addressed to Virgin Trains East Coast and an associated recommendation addressed to Network Rail relate to assessing and mitigating risks at speed restrictions. A further recommendation to Network Rail relates to replacement of operational signage when this is non-compliant with relevant standards. RAIB report also includes learning points relating to managing personal problems that could affect the safety performance of drivers. A further learning point, arising because of a delay in reporting the incident, stresses the importance of drivers promptly reporting incidents which could have caused track damage. A final learning point encourages a full understanding of the effectiveness of safety mitigation provided by infrastructure and signalling equipment. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 09/2014: Collision at Norwich \n  ", "text": "At 00:11 hrs on 21 July 2013, a passenger train operated by Greater Anglia carrying 35 passengers collided at 8 mph (13 km/h) with a train stabled in platform 6 at Norwich station. As a result of the collision, eight passengers with injuries were taken to hospital. RAIB concluded that the accident occurred because during the last 20 seconds of the driver\u2019s approach to the station, he either had a lapse in concentration or a microsleep. RAIB identified some factors which may explain the driver\u2019s possible lapse in concentration (ie the noise made by the passengers immediately behind his cab and the various thoughts occupying his attention at the time of the approach). RAIB also found that the driver had a previous operational history indicative that he was prone to lapses in concentration, and that this had not been identified by Greater Anglia\u2019s competence management system. Greater Anglia\u2019s investigations of the previous incidents that the driver had been involved in had not raised any concerns about the driver\u2019s ability to maintain concentration. This was because the driver manager who carried out the investigation had not been trained to consider that incidents, seemingly different in nature, could be linked by underlying behavioural issues. Opportunities to formally review the driver\u2019s operational history were missed and this was also not identified by the internal audits conducted by Greater Anglia. Furthermore, the driver was tired through a short-term lack of sleep, and his performance might also have been affected by the prescribed medication that he was taking. These could have been other factors leading to a lapse in concentration, or they could have led to the driver having a microsleep. RAIB has identified two learning points and made five recommendations as a result of its investigation. The learning points relate to the importance of reporting all incidents to signallers, and the importance of providing occupational health physicians with all relevant medical information during consultation. Four recommendations are addressed to Greater Anglia with respect to its competence management system, its accident and incident investigation procedures, its auditing processes and its fatigue management system. A further recommendation is addressed to Network Rail, with the support of Greater Anglia, to understand and mitigate the risk associated with permissive train movements at Norwich station.

{"title": "\n    Report 23/2014: Dangerous occurrence at Denmark Hill station\n  ", "text": "At about 16:00 hours on 1 August 2013, concrete cladding fell from the bridge spanning Denmark Hill station, London, and most of the debris landed on platform 1. The fallen concrete was reported by two train drivers and train services were stopped on the line closest to the fallen concrete. Fortunately no-one was struck and there was no damage to trains. However, train services were disrupted until 02:48 hrs the following day while emergency repairs were carried out. The concrete cladding had been added to the bridge structure in about 1910 and fell because of gradual deterioration of the fixing arrangements. Deterioration of the cladding fixing arrangements had been reported to Network Rail over a period of at least four years but the resulting actions taken by Network Rail and its works contractor were inadequate. RAIB has identified several factors which led to the absence of appropriate remedial work. Urgent repairs were not implemented in a timely manner and information collected by examiners was not entered promptly onto Network Rail\u2019s asset management database (CARRS). Communications between Network Rail\u2019s asset management and works delivery team were sometimes ineffective. Remedial work was not always precisely specified, staff implementing the work sometimes lacked the necessary competencies, and processes for verifying completion of remedial work were inadequate. Repeated reports of the same defect should have, but did not, led Network Rail to recognise that remedial works instructions were not achieving the intended effect. The high workload of some staff is a possible factor. Non-compliance with Network Rail\u2019s maximum permitted intervals between bridge examinations was noted but was not a factor in the incident. RAIB has made one recommendation and identified one learning point in addition to referencing previous RAIB recommendations relevant to issues identified at Denmark Hill. The recommendation requires Network Rail to review its processes for evaluating reported defects and managing the associated repairs. The learning point reinforces the importance of rigorously recording structure defects reported by examiners. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 16/2014: Uncontrolled evacuation train,  Holland Park station\n  ", "text": "At around 18:35 hrs on 25 August 2013, a London Underground train departing Holland Park station was brought to a halt by the first of many passenger emergency alarm activations, after smoke and a smell of burning entered the train. During the following four minutes, until the train doors still in the platform were opened by the train operator (driver), around 13 passengers, including some children, climbed out of the train via the doors at the ends of carriages. The investigation found that rising fear spread through the train when passengers perceived little or no response from the train operator to the activation of the passenger emergency alarms, the train side-doors remained locked and they were unable to open them, and they could not see any staff on the platform to deal with the situation. Believing they were in danger, a number of people in different parts of the train identified that they could climb over the top of safety barriers in the gaps between carriages to reach the platform. A burning smell from the train had been reported when the train was at the previous station, Notting Hill Gate, and although a request had been made for staff at Holland Park station to investigate the report, the train was not held in the platform for staff to respond. A traction motor on the train was later found to have suffered an electrical fault, known as a \u2018flash-over\u2019, which was the main cause of the smoke and smell. A factor underlying the passengers\u2019 response was the train operator\u2019s lack of training and experience to deal with incidents involving the activation of multiple passenger emergency alarms. The report observes that London Underground Limited (LUL) commenced an internal investigation of the incident after details appeared in the media. RAIB has made six recommendations to LUL. These seek to achieve a better ergonomic design of the interface between the train operator and passenger emergency alarm equipment, to improve the ability of train operators to respond appropriately to incidents of this type, and to ensure that train operators carry radios when leaving the cab to go back into the train so that they can maintain communications with line controllers. LUL is also recommended to review the procedures for line controllers to enable a timely response to safety critical conditions on trains and to ensure continuity at shift changeover when dealing with incidents. In addition, LUL is recommended to review the training and competencies of its staff to provide a joined-up response to incidents involving trains in platforms and to reinforce its procedures on the prompt and accurate reporting of incidents so that they may be properly investigated. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2014: Accidents at Southend Central and Whyteleafe stations\n  ", "text": "On 28 August 2013 a wheelchair user and her carer were waiting at Southend Central station for the arrival of a train when the wheelchair started to roll towards the edge of the platform, and then fell onto the track. Although the passenger and her wheelchair were recovered to the platform before the train arrived, the passenger was seriously injured in the fall. On 18 September 2013, a mother and her two young children entered Whyteleafe station, near Caterham in Surrey. As the mother was purchasing a ticket from the ticket machine on the platform, the pushchair with baby strapped in started to roll away. The mother was unaware of this until it was too late to stop the pushchair rolling off the edge of the platform and onto the track. The baby suffered minor injuries in the fall. RAIB\u2019s investigation into the accidents found that the platforms at both Southend Central and Whyteleafe stations sloped towards the railway. At the time of their construction there was no specific requirement for platforms to slope away from the railway. RAIB\u2019s investigation also found that the individuals in charge of the wheelchair and pushchair had not applied the brakes and had not noticed that the platform sloped towards the track. There was nothing to alert users of either station to the presence of the slope. The railway industry had generally recorded previous incidents of a similar nature as due solely to errors by the individuals concerned. As a consequence, the industry had not recognised the part that sloping platforms had played in the incidents. RAIB has identified one learning point for the railway industry in relation to the importance of providing a means for station staff to contact signallers in case of emergency. RAIB has made four recommendations. One recommendation has been made to Network Rail and the train operators (who as \u2018Station Facility Operators\u2019 are responsible for the safety of passengers at most stations in Britain) in respect of improvements in their processes for managing the risk of wheelchairs or pushchairs rolling off platforms. Two recommendations have been made to Network Rail for work to be undertaken to improve industry\u2019s understanding of the role played by platform slopes in incidents and accidents and methods for managing the risk, and for improving intelligence on accidents and incidents where slopes on platforms may have been a causal factor. One recommendation has been made to the Association of Train Operating Companies on the provision of guidance on methods for managing the risk of wheelchairs or pushchairs rolling off platforms. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 20/2014: Freight train derailment near Gloucester\n  ", "text": "At about 20:15 hrs on 15 October 2013, a freight train operated by Direct Rail Services, which was carrying containers, derailed about 4 miles (6.4 km) south west of Gloucester station on the railway line from Newport via Lydney. It was travelling at 69 mph (111 km/h) when the rear wheelset of the last wagon in the train derailed on track with regularly spaced dips in both rails, a phenomenon known as cyclic top. The train continued to Gloucester station where it was stopped by the signaller, who had become aware of a possible problem with the train through damage to the signalling system. By the time the train stopped, the rear wagon was severely damaged, the empty container it was carrying had fallen off, and there was damage to four miles of track, signalling cables, four level crossings and two bridges. The immediate cause of the accident was a cyclic top track defect which caused a wagon that was susceptible to this type of track defect to derail. The dips in the track had formed due to water flowing underneath the track and although the local Network Rail track maintenance team had identified the cyclic top track defect, the repairs it carried out were ineffective. The severity of the dips required immediate action by Network Rail, including the imposition of a speed restriction for the trains passing over it, but no such restriction had been put in place. Speed restrictions had repeatedly been imposed since December 2011 but were removed each time repair work was completed; on each occasion, such work subsequently proved to be ineffective. The type of wagon that derailed was found to be susceptible to wheel unloading when responding to these dips in the track, especially when loaded with the type of empty container it was carrying. This susceptibility was not identified when the wagon was tested or approved for use on Network Rail\u2019s infrastructure. RAIB also observes: the local Network Rail track maintenance team had a shortfall in its manpower resources; and design guidance for the distance between the wheelsets on two-axle wagons could also be applied to the distance between the centres of the bogies on bogie wagons. RAIB has made seven recommendations. Four are directed to Network Rail and cover reviewing the drainage in the area where the train derailed, revising processes for managing emergency speed restrictions for cyclic top track defects, providing track maintenance staff with a way of measuring cyclic top after completing repairs, and investigating how cyclic top on steel sleeper track can be effectively repaired. Two are directed to RSSB and cover reviewing how a vehicle\u2019s response to cyclic top is assessed and amending guidance on the design of freight wagons. One is directed to Direct Rail Services and covers mitigating the susceptibility of this type of wagon to cyclic top. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

There were no injuries as a consequence of the accident, although there was damage to the train and to railway infrastructure. The North London route, which carries London Overground passenger services as well as freight trains, was subsequently closed for six days. One wagon in the train ran derailed until the train reached a junction near Camden Road station. At this point, an empty container toppled off the wagon and damaged overhead line electrification equipment. The derailment was caused by a combination of the track geometry and condition, as well as the longitudinal and lateral asymmetric loading of the wagon which reduced its resistance to derailment on twisted track. RAIB has made three recommendations. These cover: As a learning point from this accident, RAIB has also identified that Network Rail should give particular attention to the possible consequences of a high turnover of responsible staff during reorganisations.\u00a0 Response to recommendations: the provision by Network Rail of guidance to managers responsible for track maintenance on the actions to be taken if measurements by track recording vehicles do not take place as planned;\u00a0 consideration of the factors that contribute to the derailment of unevenly loaded container wagons, and the associated risk, with cross-industry evaluation of the case for additional measures to mitigate the risk; and\u00a0 the clarification by RSSB of the requirements for the design and acceptance of freight wagons.

{"title": "\n    Report 14/2014: Road vehicle incursion onto the railway at Aspatria\n  ", "text": "At 10:01 hrs on 26 October 2013, an unattended commercial vehicle on the B5299 Brayton Road, Aspatria, ran away down the road. The vehicle crossed the main A596 Lawson Street, broke through a wooden fence and rolled down the side of a cutting onto the railway. Although a passenger train from Carlisle to Lancaster was approaching Aspatria at the same time, prompt action by those concerned resulted in this train being stopped about 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from the incident site. There was therefore no collision with the commercial vehicle on the track, and none of the passengers or crew on the train were actually put at risk. The management of road vehicle incursions onto the railway is described in guidance published by the Department for Transport ( ). RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the guidance does not explain how to assess the risk of a vehicle that has lost control on a side road (eg a runaway on a side road with a downhill gradient towards the railway). Also, the guidance does not describe how this risk should be combined with the risk of road vehicle incursion from the corresponding main road to give an overall risk ranking score. RAIB has made two recommendations; the first to the   to review and amend the guidance on road vehicle incursions; and the second to railway infrastructure managers, with highway authorities, to provide additional mitigation against vehicle incursions at sites where there is a significant risk of road vehicles from side roads, including of vehicles running downhill onto the railway.

{"title": "\n    Report 18/2014: Fatal accident at Barratt\u2019s Lane No.2 footpath crossing, Attenborough, Nottingham\n  ", "text": "At 14:48 hrs on Saturday 26 October 2013, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Barratt\u2019s Lane No.2 footpath crossing, at Attenborough near Nottingham. The train was travelling from Nottingham towards Birmingham. At the same time, a London to Nottingham train was slowly approaching the crossing from the other direction. It is likely that the pedestrian had concentrated her attention on the London train and did not notice the train approaching from the Nottingham direction. Both trains were fitted with forward facing closed circuit television equipment and the recording from the London to Nottingham train showed that the pedestrian approached the crossing and waited at the gate for 17 seconds before opening it; she started to cross the line 9 seconds later (the train was stopped at a red signal for part of this time). It is most likely that, having seen the London train stopped at the signal, she waited until she had determined that the train was not moving before deciding to cross the line. The sighting distances in both directions were adequate. Network Rail had assessed the risk at the crossing, in accordance with its standard procedures, and, because the risk rating was relatively high, discussed the options for reducing this risk at a meeting with the highway authority. The chosen option was to divert the footpath and close the crossing. This had not been implemented at the time of the accident as the route of the proposed diversion was obstructed by an equipment room. The room contained signalling equipment that did not become redundant until completion of the Nottingham station resignalling project at the end of August 2013. The equipment room was demolished and the footpath diverted after the accident. The RAIB has identified one learning point and has made no recommendations.  (4,608.06 kb)"},
{"title": "\n    Report 26/2014: Buffer stop collision at Chester station\n  ", "text": "At 12:12 hrs on 20 November 2013, the 10:10 hrs passenger train from London Euston to Chester collided with the buffer stop at the end of the platform as it arrived at Chester station. The impact destroyed the buffer stop and caused the leading vehicle of the train to start to override the platform, demolishing a glass screen and damaging the platform. It was fortunate that there was no-one in this area at the time. Several passengers fell over as the train stopped, but did not report injuries. One passenger was taken to hospital as a precaution and was released later the same day. The front of the train was damaged by the impact and the leading bogie was derailed. Platform 1 at Chester station was closed until 04:15 hrs on 22 November for recovery of the train and repair of the buffer stop. The accident was caused by the train sliding on wet rails that were also contaminated with leaf residue and traces of lubricating oil. The train was not equipped with automatic sanding equipment, which could have applied sand to the rails to improve adhesion. The train was fitted with emergency sanding equipment but the driver did not activate this until the train was too close to the buffers to be able to stop before striking them. The train involved was a class 221 unit operated by Virgin Trains. RAIB analysed records of low rail adhesion incidents on Network Rail infrastructure during Autumn 2013 and found several other cases of class 221 trains, and the similar class 220, encountering low adhesion when attempting to stop. In some cases the driver had to use the emergency sanding equipment. RAIB analysis found that, per attempted stop, class 220 and 221 trains were the most likely type of train to be involved in a low adhesion incident. Almost all other types of train are fitted with automatic sanding equipment, or equivalent. RAIB has identified two key learning points and made three recommendations. The operators of class 220 and 221 trains are recommended to fit equipment to their trains to automatically apply sand when wheel slide is detected during heavy braking (Virgin Trains has recently informed RAIB of its intention to fit such equipment to its fleet of class 221 trains). A recommendation is made to Virgin Trains to amend its operating instructions to drivers and a recommendation is made to RSSB to update the standard which governs the fitment of train sanding equipment. The first learning point concerns the analysis of data from train data recorders to provide information on the location of low adhesion conditions on the network. The second learning point is that infrastructure managers need to be aware of changes in traffic patterns which necessitate the reassessment of the adequacy of buffer stops in terminal platforms.

{"title": "\n    Report 13/2014: Locomotive failure near Winchfield\n  ", "text": "At about 18:50 hrs on 23 November 2013, while a steam-hauled passenger train from London Waterloo to Weymouth was approaching Winchfield in Hampshire at about 40 mph (64 km/h), the right-hand connecting rod of the locomotive became detached at its leading end (referred to as the small end), which dropped down onto the track. The driver stopped the train immediately, about one mile (1.6 km) outside Winchfield station. There was some damage to the track, but no-one was hurt. The accident could, in slightly different circumstances, have led to derailment of the train. The immediate cause of the accident was that the small end assembly came apart, allowing one end of the connecting rod to drop to the ground. The reasons for this could not be established with certainty because some components could not be found after the accident. It is possible that the gudgeon pin securing nut unwound following breakage of the cotter and previous loosening of the nut. A possible factor is that the design of some components had been modified during the restoration of the locomotive some years earlier, without full consideration of the possible effect of these changes. There were deficiencies in the design and manufacture of the cotter. It is also possible, but less likely, that the securing nut split due to an inherent flaw or fatigue cracking. RAIB has made four recommendations, directed variously to West Coast Railway Company, the Heritage Railway Association, and the Main Line Steam Locomotive Operators Association. They cover the maintenance arrangements for steam locomotives used on the national network, a review of the design of the small end assembly on the type of locomotive involved in the accident, guidance on the design and manufacture of cotters, and assessment of risk arising from changes to the details of the design of locomotives.

{"title": "\n    Report 25/2014: Collision with trolley at Bridgeway user worked crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 23:58 hrs on 16 January 2014, a passenger train travelling between Crewe and Shrewsbury struck a welder\u2019s trolley that had been placed on the line at Bridgeway user worked crossing. The train was travelling at about 85 mph (137 km/h) at the point of collision and stopped in just under 0.5 miles (0.8 km). A track worker, who was on the trolley loading it with tools, jumped clear when he became aware of the approaching train a few seconds before impact. He suffered minor injuries. The train sustained significant damage to its front and to underframe equipment, including the fuel tank, and the trolley was destroyed. Neither the train driver, conductor, nor the one passenger on board the train were injured. The group of three staff involved (Controller of Site Safety (COSS), welder and track worker) were taken back to Shrewsbury depot some four hours after the accident. The accident occurred because the trolley was placed on a line that had not been blocked to normal train operations. The Controller of Site Safety (COSS) had blocked the opposite line on the advice of the welder, who had been misled by the presentation of information in the paperwork describing the safety arrangements for the job. However, the welder later realised that the work was actually on the line that had not been blocked, but he still placed his trolley on that line believing that no train would approach because of engineering work taking place elsewhere in the area. The COSS was not directly supervising the workers when the trolley was placed on the line. Prior decisions made in work planning and resourcing, and the absence of relevant information in the paperwork about the location of the work, contributed to poor decision-making by the track workers on the night of the accident. In investigating this accident, the RAIB also observed that there were a number of deficiencies in competence management at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and that welfare arrangements for the track workers in the immediate aftermath of the accident were poor. RAIB has identified three learning points and made three recommendations, all to Network Rail. The learning points relate to competence management practices and briefings at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and the importance of staff relying on their own safe systems of work rather than making assumptions about work taking place elsewhere. The recommendations focus on the presentation of information in the paperwork describing the safety arrangements for the job, factors affecting planning decisions at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and Network Rail\u2019s competence management processes for staff on secondments or returning to work from a period of absence.

{"title": "\n    Report 22/2014: Passenger dragged by a train at Holborn station\n  ", "text": "At about 19:00 hrs on 3 February 2014, at Holborn station in central London, a passenger was dragged about ten metres along the platform by a departing Piccadilly line train, after her scarf became caught between the closing doors of one of the carriages. The train had stopped normally in the platform and passengers had alighted and boarded. A member of staff on the platform signalled to the train operator, by raising a baton, to begin the process of closing the train\u2019s doors. As the train operator started to close the doors, a passenger arrived on the platform and moved towards the train, stopping as she realised that the doors were closing. As she stopped, the end of the scarf that she was wearing round her neck continued to swing towards the train and became trapped in the closing doors. The train operator was unaware that the scarf was trapped. He started to move the train, and the passenger was dragged along the platform. The member of staff on the platform tried to help the passenger by catching hold of her, and she fell to the ground. This resulted in the scarf being forcibly removed from the passenger\u2019s neck and carried into the tunnel by the train. The passenger suffered injuries to her neck and back, but the actions of the member of staff may have saved her from being more badly hurt. The investigation found that the force required to remove the trapped scarf is likely to have been less than the maximum specified in the relevant London Underground standard, but it may have been difficult for a person taken by surprise and being dragged along the platform to exert such a force. RAIB has made one recommendation to London Underground, covering possible improvements to the means available to staff to stop trains from departing if an emergency occurs during the train despatch process. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 27/2014: Derailment at Liverpool Street station\n  ", "text": "On 23 January 2013, train 1P18, the 10:00 hrs Greater Anglia service from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, derailed near London Liverpool Street. The train comprised nine coaches pushed by a locomotive, and had just left platform 13. A total of 17 wheelsets derailed on a tight curve and, as the train proceeded, all the wheelsets were guided back onto the correct rail within a distance of 40 metres. The driver was unaware of any problem until the senior conductor told him that passengers had reported a rough ride and the signaller advised him that the signalling system had identified a problem at a set of points used by the train when leaving Liverpool Street. The driver then stopped and examined his train at Shenfield, but saw nothing unusual. No one appreciated that there had been a derailment until the train was examined by a specialist inspector when it arrived at Norwich and, at about the same time, a signal maintenance team found track damage close to Liverpool Street station. The train derailed on the curve because the track fixings had deteriorated over a period of time. This tight curve and other non-standard trackwork at Liverpool Street should have triggered consideration of mitigation measures to deal with the associated enhanced derailment risk. The investigation found that no consideration had been given to these enhanced risks because the maintenance management staff did not have the knowledge necessary to appreciate the need for, and to undertake, this activity. This lack of knowledge had not been appreciated by more senior staff. The Network Rail procedures for establishing a track inspection and maintenance regime for non-standard track did not require the regime to be independently checked. RAIB has identified six learning points and three recommendations. One learning point relates to effective communication between train and incident controllers when dealing with events which could be associated with urgent safety issues. A second learning point restates the relevance of Network Rail\u2019s existing requirements for verifying maintenance management staff competencies relevant to risk assessing track assets. Three learning points refer to the need for a complete record of assets requiring maintenance, the importance of looking for signs of rail movement when inspecting track and the correct use of data obtained from a commonly used track geometry measurement device (an Amber trolley). The final learning point refers to the need for proper archiving of inspection records. The three recommendations are all addressed to Network Rail. The first relates to providing assurance that suitable inspection regimes are established, recorded and validated for non-standard track assets. The second recommendation is intended to ensure assessment of management staff\u2019s safety critical track related competencies to ensure they have the necessary experience and knowledge to perform that role. The third recommendation seeks a review and, if necessary, improvement of the competency assessment processes applicable to managers with safety critical roles linked to the maintenance of assets other than track.

{"title": "\n    Report 28/2014: Collision at Jetty Avenue level crossing\n  ", "text": "On 14 July 2013, a passenger train approaching Woodbridge station in Suffolk struck a car at Jetty Avenue user worked level crossing The accident occurred in daylight and at low speed. The train was not derailed, but the car driver suffered minor injuries. The car driver was using the level crossing to access a private boatyard situated between the railway and the River Deben. He was a volunteer, assisting in removing equipment following a local regatta which had been held partly on land owned by the boatyard earlier in the day. The car driver had used the level crossing on previous occasions, but had not been briefed on its use. There were no telephones or warning lights at the crossing so safe use depended on vehicle drivers looking for approaching trains. The car driver, who was an occasional user of the level crosssing, normally relied on checking for trains by looking up and down the railway when swinging open the vehicular gates on foot. He did this because he was aware that his view of the railway would be obscured as he returned to the car and drove it towards the crossing. A curve in the railway meant that the train involved in the accident was not visible to the car driver when he was at the crossing, and could only be seen from this location after the driver had begun to return to his car. The driver did not become aware of the train until he had driven his car into its path. Our investigation has found that instructions given to car drivers using this, and similar, level crossings were inadequate. It also found that Network Rail\u2019s method for ensuring that vehicle drivers have an adequate view of approaching trains was incompatible with the characteristics of both the car involved in the accident and many of the vehicles expected to use crossings of this type. RAIB has made five recommendations. Four recommendations are addressed to   and cover the management of level crossings where safe use of the crossing relies on road vehicle drivers seeing approaching trains. One recommendation is made to the   and seeks clarification of its guidance on this issue. RAIB believes it is possible that the accident at Jetty Avenue user worked crossing could have been avoided by full implementation of two Recommendations in the RAIB report: \u2018Investigation into safety at user worked crossings\u2019  . These relate to guiding vehicle drivers to stop at an appropriate place before deciding whether it is safe to cross the railway.

{"title": "\n    Report 29/2014: Unauthorised entry of a train onto a single line at Greenford\n  ", "text": "At around 11:55 hrs, the 11:36 hrs passenger train from London Paddington to West Ruislip, operated by Chiltern Railways, passed two consecutive signals at danger near Greenford, west London. It was stopped when a signaller sent an emergency radio message to the driver. Although no-one was hurt in the incident, the unauthorised entry of a train onto a single line creates the potential for a serious collision. A freight train had passed the junction at Greenford shortly before the passenger train was due. Because the freight train was still occupying the line between Greenford and South Ruislip, the signaller at Greenford kept the signal at the junction at danger. The passenger train, travelling at about 20 mph (32 km/h), passed this signal and the next one, 142 yards (130 metres) further on, which was also at danger. It passed over the junction and onto the single-track section towards South Ruislip, which was still occupied by the freight train. The train had travelled about one mile (1.6 km) beyond Greenford by the time that the driver received the emergency radio message. The investigation found that the driver of the passenger train did not react to the two signals at danger, for reasons which are not certain. It is possible that he had formed the impression that the train had been given clear signals through Greenford, because of his interpretation of the meaning of the signal preceding those that he passed at danger, and he had not been stopped by signals at Greenford in the recent past. The Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) was fitted to the train and to both the signals, but it did not intervene to apply the brakes of the train, as it was intended to do. This was because the on-train TPWS equipment had self-isolated when the driver prepared the train for departure from Paddington. The isolation of the equipment was indicated by a flashing light in the cab, but the driver still drove the train. Although the signaller at Greenford wished to stop the train by sending an emergency call on the GSM-R radio system, he did not attempt to do so because the information presented by the radio equipment in the signal box suggested to him that any message he sent would not reach the train. Instead, he contacted Marylebone signal box, which was able to send a message to the train. RAIB has made three recommendations. One is addressed to Chiltern Railways, and covers the need for a review of the company\u2019s driver management processes. The other two, addressed to Network Rail, cover the configuration of the GSM-R radio system as it affects the ability of signallers to directly contact trains that are within their areas of control, and the training given to signallers in the use of the GSM-R system.

{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at Gipsy Lane footpath crossing\n  ", "text": "At about 13:52 hrs on 24 August 2011, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Gipsy Lane footpath crossing, near Needham Market in Suffolk. The train driver said that he had seen a person on the crossing, on or near to the adjacent line, as the train approached and that when the train\u2019s warning horn was sounded the pedestrian continued to cross and was struck. Although it is not possible to be certain why the pedestrian continued to cross, the RAIB considers that she either did not see the approaching train, she misjudged the speed of the train, or she believed that the train was approaching her on the line she was standing on. RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to improving the safety of pedestrians crossing the railway at Gipsy Lane, making sure level crossing data is collected accurately and consistently, developing guidance on short-term mitigation measures at level crossings that have insufficient sighting or warning of trains, and making enhancements to the cost-benefit tool that is used to assess level crossing risk mitigation measures.  edit  Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Derailment at Bordesley Junction, Birmingham\n  ", "text": "At 00:44 hrs on 26 August 2011, a freight train comprising a diesel-electric locomotive, 30 empty aggregate wagons, and an unloading wagon derailed on the approach to Bordesley Junction, Birmingham. The rear four wagons of the train, which was travelling between Banbury and Barrow-on-Soar, derailed and re-railed during the accident. There was extensive track damage at Bordesley Junction and some damage to the vehicles involved. No one was hurt. The immediate cause was that the fourth wagon from the rear derailed when its leading right-hand wheel flange climbed onto the rail head just before the junction. This was because the dynamic load on this wheel was reduced by a combination of factors related to the wagon\u2019s suspension and the track geometry: RAIB has made four recommendations, two directed to Network Rail\u2019s Network Certification Body, one to Lafarge Aggregates Ltd, and one to Network Rail. These cover making improvements to the way the risk of operating privately owned wagons is managed once a fleet wide problem is discovered, carrying out a fundamental review of how the suspension components on these wagons are maintained, implementing modifications to these wagons\u2019 suspensions which reduce the number and duration of lock-ups, and changing the process for briefing staff controlling on- track machine work so information about the priorities for their work is provided. There are also two previous RAIB recommendations that were made to Network Rail, which are relevant to this investigation. One calls for measures to improve the accuracy of location information for track geometry faults and the other calls for processes to be put in place for investigating and monitoring the repairs of repetitive track geometry faults. Their implementation is subject to ongoing correspondence between Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation.   Response to recommendations: The trailing left-hand wheel\u2019s suspension had probably locked-up (ie it had stopped responding to vertical movements) after passing over a track twist. Once locked-up, dynamic load transferred from this wheel and the diagonally opposite leading right-hand wheel to the other wheels, making this wagon more susceptible to derailing on a further track twist. The suspension had locked-up because worn suspension components were not detected during planned maintenance, and no changes had been made to this wagon\u2019s suspension, or to its maintenance regime, after testing had shown this type of suspension was prone to locking-up. An underlying cause was that no organisation took overall ownership of this problem of suspension lock- ups. There were two track twists that had been present for a long time because Network Rail staff carried out repair work in the wrong place. These track twists had formed due to the deteriorating condition of the formation, and although they were identified as repeat faults, no action was taken to investigate why these faults were recurring. Four days before the accident, planned overnight work that would have corrected these faults ran short of time, so the line where the track twists were was not worked on. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 28/2012: Near miss at Ufton level crossing\n  ", "text": "At 12:28 hours on 4 September 2011, the 11:13 hrs train from London Paddington to Bedwyn went over Ufton level crossing at a speed of 61 mph (98 km/h) while the barriers were in the raised position and the red road traffic signals were not flashing. A car approaching the crossing had to stop suddenly to avoid a collision. Engineering work meant that the equipment which normally operated the crossing automatically had been disabled and the crossing barriers and lights were being operated by an attendant located at the crossing. The incident occurred because a signaller did not carry out the rules requiring him to speak with the attendant and the train driver so that the barriers were lowered and the train approached the crossing at low speed. It is probable that these omissions were a result of a lapse and the signaller being overloaded by activities that he was required to undertake in connection with the engineering work and the resumption of passenger services after completion of this work. It is possible that the signaller actions were affected by shortcomings in the presentation of information on the display screens used at his workstation. Inadequate consideration of signallers\u2019 workload associated with engineering work is considered a probable underlying cause. RAIB has made seven recommendations addressed to Network Rail. Five directly relate to the incident and cover presentation of information on display screens used by signallers; the introduction of an interface intended to remind signallers to take appropriate precautions when automatic crossings are being controlled by attendants; and consideration of signallers\u2019 workload when planning engineering work. Two recommendations, based on observations made during the investigation, relate to the positioning and removal of the red flags and red lights used by level crossing attendants to stop trains. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Incident near Haslemere, Surrey\n  ", "text": "At approximately 03:00 hrs on 10 September 2011, a hand trolley ran unattended for a distance of 2.9 miles (4.6 km) along the Portsmouth main line near Haslemere. The incident occurred within an overnight engineering possession and there were no casualties. The trolley operator did not know he was on a long falling gradient when he let go of the trolley and the brakes on the trolley failed to apply automatically. The brake mechanism probably jammed with the brakes in the \u2018off\u2019 position due to a combination of factors including inadequacies in the design, risk assessment and acceptance processes, and in the subsequent maintenance of the trolley. RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to the training and competence of trolley operators, the product acceptance process, reviewing the actions it has taken since the incident, alternative means of communication in areas of poor mobile phone reception and the process for reviewing RAIB recommendations made to other operators. One recommendation is made to Torrent Trackside, the maintainer of the trolley, to improve the competence of its staff to maintain equipment. As a learning point from this incident, RAIB has also identified that duty holders should have effective processes for making sure their staff are made aware of changes in the Rule Book which are relevant to the work they perform.

{"title": "\n    Report 13/2013: Partial failure of a structure inside Balcombe Tunnel\n  ", "text": "Early on the morning of 23 September 2011, the crew of an engineering train passing through Balcombe tunnel observed that part of a large steel structure mounted in the roof of the tunnel, spanning over both railway tracks, was sagging down. An emergency inspection found that on one side of the structure, three supports had become detached from the tunnel lining leaving a 12 metre length partially supported. The structure, one of six within the tunnel, was intended to catch water dripping from the tunnel roof. It was supported by anchor studs fixed with polyester resin into holes drilled in the tunnel\u2019s brick lining. Within the tunnel, 18 studs (5%) were found to be missing and a further five studs were loose. The RAIB\u2019s investigation has found that this connection was inadequate because the resin was not compatible with the tunnel brickwork and may have been adversely affected by shrinkage and the damp conditions in the tunnel. It is probable that the resin was selected using inadequate technical data and probable that insufficient resin was placed around some studs. Although some railway staff were aware that studs had fallen from the structure on more than one occasion since 2008, this did not result in appropriate risk mitigation. This was because of inadequacies in the reporting of these events and because there was insufficient support for a member of railway staff who was managing some aspects of the tunnel maintenance but had limited experience. Inadequate access for tunnel examinations due to conflicting demands on the limited available access is considered to be an underlying factor. RAIB has identified three learning points from this incident: the need to consider the adequacy of information contained in manufacturer\u2019s data sheets; the need to maintain awareness of published information; and the benefit of marking significant tunnel defects such that they are visible from track level. RAIB has made nine recommendations addressed to Network Rail that focus on managing existing polyester resin connections and controlling the future use of this material; confirming the compatibility of materials during design work; effective responses to defects and abnormal events; competency of staff managing structures; access for examining structures; the examination process for structures in tunnels; and retention of records relating to structures.

The impact between the train and the tractor caused the front of the tractor to be separated from the driving cab. The tractor driver remained in the cab of the tractor, but suffered a broken collarbone, lacerations and bruising. The tractor moved onto the crossing when the train was no more than 100 metres away and travelling at 70 mph (113 km/h). The train driver sounded the train\u2019s horn and applied the emergency brake, but was unable to prevent the collision. The second wheelset on the train derailed after the collision occurred, but the train remained upright and in line while stopping. The train driver suffered a chest injury and shock in the accident. No-one else on the train was injured. Evacuation of passengers took place after three hours because equipment providing electrical power to trains had become dislodged and was hanging close to the track. At the time of the accident, there were frequent movements of tractors and trailers over the crossing because of activity associated with the harvesting of sugar beet in an adjacent field. The tractor driver was telephoning the signaller at Kings Lynn to ask for permission to cross on each occasion. This was not the normal method of working; usually, crossing users would check that it was safe to cross before doing so and the signaller at Kings Lynn would not be aware that the crossing was being used. The accident occurred because the signaller gave the tractor driver permission to cross before seeking confirmation that the train had passed. The tractor driver did not check for approaching trains because he considered that the signaller\u2019s permission to cross was sufficient guarantee that it was safe to do so. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has made no recommendations. However, three learning points directly relevant to the causes or consequences of this accident have been identified: The RAIB has identified a further four learning points related to matters observed during its investigation, but not directly relevant to its cause or consequences. They cover:  (950.89 kb)  signallers need to be made aware of the need to ensure that safety-critical messages are delivered in the right way; when non-standard methods are to be applied for operating a UWC, it is important that all parties involved jointly review the proposed method of working, which should then be documented and confirmed in order that misunderstandings can be avoided; and the availability of staff for earthing overhead line equipment at remote locations. the measurement of sighting distances as part of the assessment of safety at level crossings; engagement between Network Rail and authorised users when assessing risk at UWCs so that the way in which the crossing is used can be considered as part of the exercise; checks on telephones and the accuracy of signs at level crossings; and keeping information on authorised users current."},
{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at Mexico footpath crossing \n  ", "text": "At around 15:50 hrs on 3 October 2011, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Mexico footpath crossing, near Penzance in Cornwall. On approaching the crossing round a curve, the train driver had observed a person standing to the side of the line and had sounded the warning horn immediately before the train reached the crossing. However, the pedestrian then attempted to cross and was struck. Although it is not possible to be certain why the pedestrian attempted to cross, RAIB considers that she either misjudged the speed of the approaching train or misjudged her position in relation to the approaching train. She probably saw the train too late to make a reasoned judgement about whether she should cross. The driver had also sounded the train\u2019s horn as required by a lineside \u2018whistle\u2019 board when the train was approximately 15-16 seconds from the crossing, and out of sight. If the pedestrian had heard and responded to the sounding of the train\u2019s horn at this stage, it is likely that she would not have passed through the gate and onto the crossing until the train had passed. RAIB considers that the sounding of the horn when the train was 15-16 seconds from the crossing did not serve its function of warning the crossing user of the approaching train for one of the following reasons: RAIB has made five recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail regarding improvements to sighting and warning arrangements for pedestrians using Mexico footpath crossing, developing a national approach to the location and marking of decision points at level crossings and optimising warning arrangements for pedestrians at level crossings provided with whistle boards. One recommendation (in two parts) has been made to RSSB regarding improving intelligence on near-miss incidents at level crossings and enhancing its processes for reviewing the effect of changes made in 2007 to arrangements for sounding train horns at whistle boards. One recommendation has been made to First Great Western regarding a change to standards to require objective testing of horns after a train has been involved in an incident or accident. Response to recommendations: the sound of the horn was inaudible to her she heard a horn being sounded, but did not distinguish it as coming from a train she did not register that the train horn was sounded, because she was only approaching the crossing at this time and not yet focused on crossing the railway. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Incident at King\u2019s Cross station\n  ", "text": "A passenger became trapped in a train door and was pulled along a platform, for a distance of approximately 20 metres, at London King\u2019s Cross station on 10 October 2011. She suffered bruising to the fingers of her left hand. The passenger\u2019s hand became trapped when she attempted to board the train while the doors were closing. The train started to move before the passenger\u2019s fingers were released because a member of staff on the platform did not fully check the train doors before signalling that the train could depart. The requirement to check doors is given in the railway Rule Book. It is possible that the passenger could have withdrawn her fingers from the doors, before being pulled along the platform, if alternative door edge seals had been fitted on the Class 365 train involved in the incident. When the passenger alarm was operated during the incident, the train did not stop immediately because the driver decided to continue to the next station. This decision had no effect on the incident but was contrary to the railway Rule Book and, in lightly different circumstances, could have increased the severity of the accident. RAIB has identified two learning points from this accident: RAIB has also recommended that, the design of door edge seals on Class 365 trains is reviewed, and if appropriate modified, when the seals are renewed as part of a mid-life refurbishment due in 2013.   Response to recommendations:   the importance of fully checking train doors before trains depart; and the need for drivers to stop trains immediately if the passenger alarm is operated when any part of the train is within a station.

{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at James Street station\n  ", "text": "At 23:29 hrs on 22 October 2011, a young person was struck and killed by the train she had left 30 seconds earlier. She was leaning against the train as it began to move out of the station and when she fell, the platform edge gap was wide enough for her to fall through and onto the track. Her post-mortem toxicology report recorded a blood alcohol concentration nearly three times the UK legal drink drive limit. The guard dispatched the train while the young person was leaning against it. The RAIB concluded it is possible that he did this because he had seen her but expected her to move away before the train moved or that he looked briefly in her direction but did not see her or that he did not see her because his attention was on his control panel and a large group of people on the platform. Platform video camera footage shows him warning her to stand back in the moments before the train departs and it is likely he did this because he thought that it would be immediately effective and because he had no direct and immediate way to stop the train. While the rail industry\u2019s overall safety record has improved in recent years, accidents at the platform/train interface have increased, even when accounting for an increased number of passenger journeys over a period of time which saw a known industry hazard (trains with slam doors but no central locking) withdrawn from service. This indicates that the industry\u2019s focus on operational matters has not delivered improved safety at the platform/train interface, and there is a need to consider technical as well as operational solutions to reduce the risk. This report makes three recommendations: one is for Merseyrail to evaluate and where practical improve the means of train dispatch. The second is for Merseyrail, in consultation with other relevant organisations, to evaluate equipment and methods to reduce the likelihood of persons falling through the platform edge gap and to implement these measures when practical. The third is for the Office of Rail Regulation to ensure that there is industry guidance on reducing the risk at the platform/train interface; in particular the guidance should consider both equipment and methods of operation.

{"title": "\n    Report 25/2012: Collision between car and train at Stowmarket Road\n  ", "text": "At about 19:36 hrs on 30 November 2011 a car that was being driven on the B1113 Stowmarket Road, towards the village of Old Newton in Suffolk, left the carriageway and passed through the wire fence onto the railway line north of Stowmarket. The driver of the car was injured, but was able to escape to a place of safety, and reported the accident to Suffolk Police. A short time later the car was struck by the 18:43 hrs Cambridge to Ipswich train. Fortunately the train did not derail and neither passengers nor members of the train crew were physically injured. The immediate cause of the accident on the highway was that the driver of the car lost control of his vehicle. The subsequent collision with the train occurred because the car came to rest in a position where it was obstructing the railway line and there was insufficient time to stop the train. Suffolk County Council had undertaken a risk assessment in 2005 and assessed the risk of road vehicle incursion at the location where the accident occurred. It had not implemented steps to control the risk of incursion. Network Rail was also aware of the risk at the location, but had no process in place to monitor the actions of local highway authorities to address the risk of road vehicle incursions and had assumed that Suffolk County Council was taking suitable actions. A number of underlying factors were identified which showed Network Rail\u2019s awareness of road vehicle incursion incident sites was limited, and the joint risk management process adopted by Network Rail and Suffolk County Council in 2003 (following the fatal train accident at Great Heck in 2001) had not been completed. As a consequence, the investigation identified that there were nine locations within Suffolk where action to reduce RVI risk had still to be taken. Network Rail has identified over 200 sites on the national rail network where action has still to be taken to reduce the risk of road vehicle incursion. It was also found that the Department for Transport\u2019s (DfT) monitoring of the progress to mitigate the risk at known sites with significant road vehicle incursion risk was not effective, nor did it emphasise to local highway authorities and Network Rail the requirement to complete such works. The RAIB considers that regulatory oversight by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) of works to address the risk of road vehicle incursion was affected by a lack of clarity as to which body has enforcement powers to require local highway authorities to take action. RAIB has made two recommendations to Suffolk County Council. These cover: RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. These cover: RAIB has made one recommendation to the ORR and HSE. This covers the need to clarify which body has regulatory and enforcement responsibility relating to the management of road vehicle incursion risk. RAIB has made four recommendations to the Department for Transport. These cover: Response to recommendations: the need for an independent review of the actions it has taken since the accident to address the deficiencies in its process for the management of road vehicle incursion risk; and the need to improve the flow of information to parish and district councils and the police on related matters. a review of the current data on road vehicle incursion sites; and improvements to the way road vehicle incursion risk is monitored. the need to monitor progress with the implementation of risk mitigation measures at road vehicle incursion sites; establishment of a mechanism for the lessons learnt from this investigation to be disseminated to other local highway authorities improving the exchange of information that is relevant to the risk of road vehicle incursion gathering intelligence on high risk road vehicle incursion locations as an input to emergency planning.

The impact between the train and the lorry caused the lorry to be separated from its trailer and pushed along the track by the train. The lorry driver left his cab prior to the impact but was struck by the trailer and slightly injured during the collision. The lorry had stopped on the crossing when the barriers lowered for the approaching train. The train driver saw the lorry when the train was 270 metres away and travelling at 68 mph (109 km/h). The train driver applied the emergency brake, but the train was unable to stop before reaching the crossing. The train was not derailed but 27 passengers were injured in the collision, one seriously, and four received treatment in hospital before being discharged later the same day. The train conductor and the catering host received minor injuries and were treated in hospital and the driver suffered shock. The accident occurred because the lorry driver did not telephone the signaller for permission to cross and because local factors encouraged him to take a line towards the right of the road. Road signs, in English and Welsh, on the approach to the crossing instructed drivers of large or slow vehicles to phone the signaller for permission to cross the railway. The road signs defined the terms \u2018large\u2019 and \u2018slow\u2019 and the lorry and trailer were of such a length, and were likely to have been travelling at such a speed, that the lorry fell within the scope of both of these terms. A number of factors forced the lorry and trailer to use the right-hand side of the road to pass over the crossing; the orientation of the road over the crossing being misaligned with the rest of the road, the position of one of the road traffic light signals and the position of vehicles parked close to the crossing. While travelling slowly over the crossing the barrier on the exit side came down in front of the lorry, causing the lorry driver to stop his vehicle. RAIB has made six recommendations as follows:   Response to recommendations: Network Rail in conjunction with the ORR to revise the crossing order and reduce the effect of road misalignment at the crossing The ORR to revise its guidance to cover misalignment of the road and the ability for a large vehicle to exit an AHB crossing when the barriers descend Network Rail to revise its risk management process for level crossings to include the effect of road misalignment Network Rail to give guidance to its staff and contractors on where to park when working on or near level crossings Angel Trains to examine how to mitigate the risk to the driver from detachment of cab panels during a collision Alstom and Angel Trains to review the coupler bump stop mounting and retention arrangements.

{"title": "\n    Report 06/2013: Accident involving a pantograph and the overhead line near Littleport\n  ", "text": "At 07:19 hrs on 5 January 2012, the pantograph assembly fell from the roof of a passenger train, breaking two windows on its way to the ground. The train, the 06:51 hrs service from Kings Lynn to London King\u2019s Cross, was travelling at approximately 80 mph (129 km/h), about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Littleport, in Cambridgeshire, when the accident happened. The train stopped 1.75 miles (2.8 km) after the accident location. One passenger received treatment for minor cuts at the site, and two others suffered minor shock but did not require medical treatment. There was extensive damage to the overhead line equipment and minor damage to the train body. The investigation identified that the pantograph head had lost contact with, and risen above, the overhead line, resulting in the pantograph arm hitting a cantilever overhead line support structure. This impact broke the electrical insulators on which the pantograph assembly was mounted, allowing it to fall from the roof. The pantograph head lost contact because the overhead line was deflected from its intended position due to a combination of long term movements of the overhead line support mast foundations and the force of the wind at the time of the accident. The RAIB concluded that maintenance of the overhead line had not been carried out in accordance with Network Rail standards, meaning that the overhead line had not been adjusted to allow for long term foundation movements. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. They are concerned with: The RAIB has also identified a learning point for the railway industry concerning the possible use of polymeric or composite insulators to support pantographs. Response to recommendations: ensuring that the risk associated with the authorisation of non-compliances with maintenance standards are assessed and mitigated providing overhead line maintenance personnel with information that allows them to effectively manage overhead line alignment.

{"title": "\n    Report 02/2013: Freight train derailment at Reading West Junction\n  ", "text": "At 13:42 hrs on 28 January 2012 a wagon on a container train derailed, and then re-railed, when crossing a section of track connecting two lines (a crossover) at Reading West Junction. No-one was injured. However, the condition of the train was such that the derailment could have taken place elsewhere, in which case the consequences might have been more severe. The train was formed of 25 container-carrying flat wagons. The wagon that derailed was the 24th from the front. It was carrying a single freight container on the trailing end, which was packed with 13 pallets of automotive components, each weighing approximately 1300 kg. On opening the container, the RAIB found that all the pallets were unsecured and had moved to the side, resulting in uneven loading of the wagon. A survey of the track revealed a geometry defect (a twist fault) close to the point of derailment. The cause of the derailment was that there was insufficient load on the front right-hand wheel of the wagon to prevent its flange climbing over the railhead. This was the combined result of the uneven loading on the wagon, specifically the lateral offset of the payload in the container, and the effect of the twist fault on the crossover. The RAIB concluded that the pallets had moved during the road journey to the freight terminal where the container was loaded onto the train. Schaeffler Automotive, the company that packed the container, had no processes at the time to ensure that the pallets would not move. The checks and handling methods used by Freightliner, the operator of the terminal, did not detect the offset load. Although the size of the twist fault did not require the line to be blocked to traffic, Network Rail\u2019s processes for track inspection and maintenance had not identified that it existed. The RAIB has made five recommendations, one directed to the Health and Safety Executive, two to Freightliner and two to Network Rail. They are concerned with: \u00a0 Response to recommendations: making relevant parties aware of the need to pack freight containers in accordance with published guidance, and gaining assurance that this is being done; the detection of at-risk freight containers and wagons before they enter traffic; the detection of track geometry defects after mechanised maintenance; and minimising the formation of track geometry defects during mechanised maintenance.

{"title": "\n    Report 27/2012: Fatal accident at Johnson\u2019s footpath crossing \n  ", "text": "At about 11:40 hrs on 28 January 2012, a train struck and fatally injured a pedestrian who was using Johnson\u2019s footpath crossing, in Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Hertfordshire. The pedestrian started to walk over the crossing as a train was approaching, despite warnings provided by a red miniature stop light and an audible alarm, and crossed into the path of the train. The investigation found that proposals from various bodies to close Johnson\u2019s footpath crossing before 2007 had not been translated into action. In addition, Network Rail had not developed a proposal to install a footbridge to replace the crossing, after an analysis undertaken in 2007 had shown that the benefits of so doing would exceed the costs. Following a further cost-benefit analysis in 2010, a footbridge was in development and has since been installed; Johnson\u2019s footpath crossing was closed on 1 August 2012. RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail, one of which requires consultation with RSSB. These relate to an investigation into ways to make cost-effective improvements to the conspicuity of miniature stop light indications, to possible improvements in the visibility of approaching trains at level crossings equipped with miniature stop lights and to a review of options which had previously been identified for reducing risk at level crossings.

{"title": "\n    Report 24/2012: Derailment at Bletchley Junction\n  ", "text": "At 02:27 hrs on 3 February 2012, an electric locomotive that was being driven from Crewe to Wembley, on the West Coast Main Line, derailed as it negotiated the diverging route at Bletchley Junction. The locomotive was travelling at a speed of 65.5 mph (105.4 km/h) when it derailed: the speed limit for the diverging route was 15 mph (24 km/h). The driver received minor injuries and significant damage was caused to the underside of the locomotive, the track and the overhead electrification equipment. The driver of the locomotive correctly reduced its speed on the approach to the red signal before the junction but when this changed to green, with an \u2018F\u2019 indication meaning that the locomotive was to take the diverging route, the driver applied full power in the belief that he was going straight on. It is likely that the driver only realised that he was to take the diverging route around the time he was passing the signal, by which time it was too late to prevent the derailment. RAIB found that the driver did not immediately observe and/or register what was displayed by the signal\u2019s route indicator even though he understood its meaning. This was despite the fact that the approach view of the route indicator was found to be satisfactory, free of obstructions and with sufficient time for a driver to see and understand its meaning. RAIB has concluded that the driver\u2019s belief that he was continuing on the up slow line overcame the fact that the \u2018F\u2019 indication was clearly visible to him. RAIB has made one recommendation to Virgin Trains covering the training and assessment of drivers\u2019 route knowledge, and two recommendations to Network Rail. The first of these relates to the assessment of the risk from overspeeding at diverging junctions when the signal before the junction clears from red to a proceed indication, and the second relates to clarifying the status of the Weekly Operating Notice, an operating publication which is issued to drivers, and which contained information about engineering work south of Bletchley requiring trains to take the diverging route at Bletchley Junction.

{"title": "\n    Report 04/2013: Derailment of a tram at East Croydon\n  ", "text": "On  17 February 2012 at about 06:23 hrs, a westbound tram derailed after passing over facing points as it approached the platform at East Croydon. The tram was running one minute behind the tram ahead, and was routed left to follow it towards platform 3. As the tram travelled forwards at low speed, the points moved under its leading bogie, forcing its centre and rear bogies right towards platform 2. The centre bogie derailed as the routes diverged. Approximately 100 passengers were detrained close to the platform. There were no reported injuries. The main cause of this accident was that a track circuit failed to respond to an approaching tram and lock the points to prevent movement. The track circuit was not correctly adjusted and the rail head may have been contaminated with silt. The RAIB also found that system integration was inadequate. RAIB has made three recommendations to London Tramlink that focus on operational and signalling arrangements, the control of silt and rail head contamination, and track circuit settings. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

The causal factors which led to the derailment of train 2C31 include: the warm weather and insufficient expansion gaps in the jointed track; control of rail creep in the area of the derailment was not effective; the tight joints in the vicinity of the derailment site were not reported; the track was disturbed at a naturally weak point on the day before the derailment; a lack of recognition of the risk being imported by disturbing the track; the speed of train 2C31; and communications and instructions passed between the signaller and driver. RAIB has made five recommendations concerning improved standards for the maintenance and repair of jointed track; identifying and monitoring sections of jointed track on the network which have similar characteristics to the track which buckled at Cummersdale; re-briefing of signallers on the correct actions to take when a track defect has been reported which could endanger a train; introduction of a specific requirement in the Rule Book for train drivers to clarify with the signaller what the maximum speed should be when examining the line.

The immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian walked onto the crossing as the train approached and was unable to get clear in time to avoid being struck. The causal factors which led to the accident were: that (although there is no direct evidence) as she approached the crossing, she may have been distracted when making her decision to cross the line by the presence of her dogs; the way that pedestrians approaching the crossing may have used the longer view of approaching trains obtainable from a position a short distance back from the gate on the up side; the absence of \u2018whistle\u2019 boards on the approach to the crossing. A possible contributory factor was the absence of an adequate risk assessment for the level crossing and an underlying factor was the difficulty of closing the level crossing, and its continued availability to members of the public as a footpath RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail concerning the way it manages the risk to users of footpath crossings; modification of the level crossing risk model to improve its sensitivity to low sighting times; and provision of guidance to its staff assessing crossings on methods of marking the point at which level crossing users should stand to get the best view to enable them to make their decision to cross the track.

{"title": "\n    Damage to trains at Penrith station and Eden Valley loop\n  ", "text": "On 4 July 2009 a freight container train was travelling from Grangemouth, Scotland to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal when two container doors came open and struck three passenger trains on the West Coast Main Line between 16:02 hrs and 16:27 hours. There were no casualties as a result of the collision however the container doors and the passenger trains were damaged. The container doors had come open without being identified. The evidence indicates that it is most likely that the doors came open as a result of criminal action. The collisions with the passenger trains occurred because there was no feature on the container or wagon to prevent open container doors from going out of the allowable space envelope for loads carried on the railway. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations targeted at freight operating companies.

{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at Norbreck\n  ", "text": "On 5 August 2009, at around 10:06 hrs, tram number 719, running south from Cleveleys towards Blackpool, struck a pedestrian who was crossing the tramway on a roadway crossing at Norbreck tram-stop.\u00a0 The pedestrian suffered serious injuries and died in hospital around five weeks later.  The immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian stepped into the path of the tram, which was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision.  The causal factors which led to the accident were: the tram driver did not perceive the risk in time to stop the tram, or provide a warning in sufficient time to avoid the accident; the tram\u2019s speed on the approach to the tram-stop and crossing was around 20 mph (32 km/h) and this was contrary to the way the driver had been trained; the tram did not stop at the tram-stop; the pedestrians were unaware of the immediate proximity of the tram, because seeing people waiting in the tram-stop shelter led them to assume that the tram would stop.\u00a0 As a result, they did not look to their left again as they crossed until just before the collision. The probable causal factors were: the tram driver\u2019s attention was to the left-hand side approaching the crossing; the tram driver incorrectly believed that the people in the tram shelter did not want to board the tram; and it is feasible that the combination of factors relating to the way the tram was driven were caused by the driver\u2019s inexperience.  A possible contributory factor was the lack of a speed limit sign. RAIB has made two recommendations to Blackpool Transport Services concerning the development and documentation of a company-wide policy for the determination and application of speed limits throughout the network; and the development and documentation of an effective and consistent system to monitor compliance with speed limits among tram drivers.

The immediate cause of the collision was the lower points moving under the uphill tram directing the rear of the tram into the path of the downhill tram. The causal factors were: the wheel forces overcoming the tumbler\u2019s holding force and changing the position of the points; the effectiveness of the holding force on the points had reduced due to wear and degradation of the points and the tumbler; that the points at the upper loop did not have a facing point lock; and the Great Orme Tramway did not routinely measure the condition of the points and the tumbler mechanism because they did not have procedures for such measurements and for associated remedial actions. RAIB has made two recommendations to Conwy Borough Council concerning: conducting a competent technical evaluation of the points and crossings on the Great Orme Tramway; comprehensive and competent audits carried out to identify any deficiencies associated with the operation and maintenance of the Tramway.

The immediate cause was the parting of the overhead wire because of local overheating caused by the high electric current flowing from the wire to one of the train\u2019s pantographs. The causal factor was an incorrect distance between the points of the electrodes on the lightning arrester caused a flashover. The probable causal factors were: incorrect connection of cables in the circuit detecting the flow of excessive current to the OHLE; the absence of continuity testing during commissioning of the supply system protection equipment; the margin between the specified performance of the protection equipment and OHLE, and the conditions that caused the OHLE to fail was small.\u00a0 Had the specification provided a greater margin, it is more likely that the OHLE would have survived intact.\u00a0 RAIB has made seven recommendations concerning: the design and/or maintenance of the lightning arrestor; review of quality management processes relating to the installation, testing and commissioning of safety related railway equipment; the possibility of reducing the risk associated with damaged OHLE of the tramway type falling onto station platforms; the review, and if appropriate amendment, of the requirements for the performance of electrification systems being brought into use; investigating an effective means of reminding the controller of the correct procedure to be followed before closing a circuit breaker; reviewing the induction procedures for new shift managers so that they are made aware of the procedures to be followed by electrical controllers following an automatic trip; and making permanent the temporary instruction to electrical controllers that staff at St Pancras are to be contacted to confirm that all persons are in positions of safety before attempting to reclose a circuit breaker that has opened automatically. \u00a0\n   Response to recommendations:   RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

There were no injuries to anybody on the train which was not derailed.\u00a0 Investigation concluded that the driver of the car did not react to the road traffic light signals and drove onto the level crossing at the same time as the train arrived. An underlying factor was that Network Rail did not properly understand the risk at Halkirk level crossing because it had not taken the previous accident record into account. Had it done so, the level of risk might have justified more costly risk reduction measures, and risk reduction measures that had been identified might have been implemented more quickly and before the accident occurred. Additional observations noted by RAIB include: confusion among the staff undertaking level crossing inspections about the difference between visibility and alignment; and the current design of long hoods fitted to road traffic light signals does not mitigate the effect of falling sunlight for all sun angles. RAIB has made six recommendations to Network Rail which include the risk assessment of the level crossing; the maintenance of the backboards of the road traffic light signals; and the design of long hoods fitted at level crossings.

The train was formed of a class 73 locomotive leading a five-car Class 201 Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU), with two further class 73 locomotives on the rear.  The immediate cause of the derailment was that the track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 1Z75 passed over.  The causal factors which led to the incident were: a discrepancy in recording the poor condition of the sleepers which led to the actual fault being subject to a lower level of surveillance by the Track Section Manager; the condition of the sleepers at Windsor and Eton Riverside station had not been reported on a weekly basis; that action was not taken by the Track Section Manager to replace the decaying sleepers; the Track Maintenance Engineer not following up his request for the work to be undertaken; non-identification of the widening gauge in platform 1 at Windsor and Eton Riverside; and the non-application of tie-bars as a temporary measure.  RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail regarding revisions to its current competency training programme for all staff involved in track inspection; development of a proposal for the periodic measurement of dynamic gauge at potentially vulnerable locations not covered by a track recording vehicle; and ensuring that its procedures for planning audits are amended to a review of the findings from previous relevant audits and action taken.

{"title": "\n    Derailment near Gillingham tunnel\n  ", "text": "During the evening of 28 November 2009, a London to Yeovil train ran into a landslip in a cutting on the eastern approach to Gillingham tunnel in Dorset. The leading carriage of the train became derailed and the train ran into the tunnel and stopped 200 metres inside. The landslip was caused by water overflowing from a blocked ditch at the top of the cutting slope. Two passengers reported minor injuries and the leading carriage of the train and around 450 metres of railway track were damaged.  The immediate cause of the accident was a landslip triggered by water overflowing from a blocked ditch. The causal factors were: the Victorian cutting design did not take adequate account of the interaction between geology, groundwater and heavy rainfall; roots were not dealt with properly during maintenance work and the person who inspected the ditch did not have appropriate guidance about how to deal with roots; there was no Network Rail process for establishing the drainage ditch condition; and there had been a lack of action in response to an earlier memorandum.

The first indication of a problem was a track defect reported by a train driver crossing the bridge on the up line. Track maintenance staff, called to the site, immediately blocked the up line to all traffic when they became aware of a serious defect with the bridge. The down line was blocked shortly afterwards.\u00a0 A total of 21 trains crossed the failing bridge between the first report and closure of the line. There was no derailment and no injuries occurred. The immediate cause was that the east abutment of bridge 48 was undermined by scour - the removal of material by the action of flowing water. The causal factors were: the obstruction of the watercourse, which channelled the flow towards the east abutment, increasing its velocity and making it more likely that scour would occur; Network Rail being unaware of the obstruction and therefore not taking action to mitigate the risk of scour; and the vulnerability of the east abutment of the bridge to undermining by scour. A contributory factor was the lack of a mechanism to encourage members of the public who were aware of the obstruction to report it to Network Rail.

The immediate cause of the derailment was the flange of the leading right-hand wheel of the leading bogie of wagon 610117 climbing over the right-hand rail at the point where it changed section from UIC60 to BS113A. The causal factors were: the track had been installed with a radius that was sharper than designed and was not fitted with a check rail; one of the transition rails had been installed incorrectly; the frame of the vehicle which derailed was twisted, and the sidebearers of this wagon were fitted with packings that did not compensate for this twist. RAIB has made four recommendations concerning: a system to assess and mitigate, so far as is reasonably practicable, the risk arising from twisted frames on container wagons and audit compliance with it; checking other sites where the same project team had installed track to verify that it has been designed and installed correctly; updating Network Rail\u2019s processes for track management to include checks that the rail fastening components are of the correct type for the particular rail and sleeper combination; and updating Network Rail\u2019s track recording information handling process to deal with gauge variation and should issue guidance to staff on minimum actions to be taken at each alarm level.

The immediate cause of the accident was that the west-facing lookout did not move from the path of the train as it approached. The causal factors were that the west-facing lookout: moved from a safe position and was possibly unaware that he was in the path of trains and was possibly unaware that a train was approaching him. RAIB also observed that: the Yorkshire Ambulance Service driver could not find the accident location without assistance as the access point had a grid reference but not a postcode and on another occasion this has the potential to cause delay; the work was planned to take place while the track remained open to trains; there were errors in the safe system of work; and the Huddersfield lines were re-opened in view of the accident site. RAIB made two recommendations concerning: consideration of ways to reduce the risk of lookouts moving dangerously close to trains and if appropriate making arrangements to physically identify a safe position; and the ambulance services of the United Kingdom should consider ways to reduce the risk of ambulance drivers being unable to find places on the railway that do not have postcodes and if appropriate make arrangements for them to navigate to those places.

Shortly after this happened, a train approached on the down line and the wheelchair user was forced to pull himself out of the wheelchair, which was subsequently struck by the train.\u00a0 The wheelchair user suffered minor injuries in the incident. The immediate cause was that one of the front wheels of the wheelchair became stuck in an area of ballast in the south-west corner of the crossing. The causal factors were: the non-application of asphalt to the full length of the south side of the crossing during the renewal work and that this uneven interface was not identified during a number of crossing inspections and risk assessments; it was dark at the time of the incident, which made it difficult for the wheelchair user to see the area of ballast in the corner of the crossing; and the skewed angle between the railway and the road, meant the wheelchair user was not able to follow a straight path at the side of the level crossing RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail concerning level crossing surfaces, level crossing inspections, minimising the hazards to users of small-wheeled vehicles on level crossings and the management of safety-related work at level crossings.

After it started braking, the freight train took almost two and a half miles to stop. It finally came to a stand over Carstairs Station junction, shortly after the passage of a passenger train. Actions taken by the signaller stopped the freight train from travelling towards a second passenger train that was also approaching Carstairs. Nobody was injured and there was no damage to trains or infrastructure. However, under slightly different circumstances, the incident may have led to either a collision between trains or a derailment. The freight train\u2019s braking performance was very poor for a train of its type and was caused by snow and ice ingress stopping the brake equipment on its wagons from working properly. A combination of factors led to this situation occurring: RAIB has made three recommendations. Two of the recommendations made are to freight operating companies in conjunction with the Rail Safety & Standards Board (RSSB) and relate to changes to the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions. The third recommendation is made to the freight operating companies and calls for a review of the safety impact of operating freight trains in snowy conditions, so that specific risk control measures can be identified and imposed when justified by the conditions. Response to recommendations: the way that the driver applied the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions the speed of the train, and as a result the amount of lying snow that it then disturbed the train entering into service with snow and ice already on its brake equipment.

These cover:   Response to recommendations:   an incorrect shape following earlier remedial grinding no lubrication following the grinding, although this was required by Network Rail\u2019s own standards. ensuring that hands-on training is given for new tools assessing the risks of installing points on concrete slab bases and researching the effects of derailments on them, (to establish whether the rigidity of the track contributed to the coach overturn) reviewing how Network Rail checks maintenance work on points.\n\u00a0 RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Collision near St John\u2019s Wood\n  ", "text": "At around 02:40 hrs on 25 October 2007, an engineering unit (consisting of a motorised electric track trolley, carrying four persons, and two loaded trailers) failed to slow down at the rate the driver expected. The engineering unit was travelling at approximately 10 mph (16 km/h) from St John\u2019s Wood station towards Baker Street station on the London Underground Jubilee southbound line. The engineering unit collided at slow speed with two manual trolleys. There were no injuries. The RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause which was that the emergency brake failed to slow the engineering unit at the rate expected by the Track Trolley Operator. Causal factors were that the trailer connected to the electric track trolley had non-operational emergency brakes, that the the second trailer had only 50% operational emergency brakes, and the poor performance of the braking systems on the engineering unit. The mechanical design of the braking system of the trailers was also of a sensitive nature, which had resulted in the emergency brakes jamming in the off position on one trailer. The RAIB has also identified contributory and underlying factors. The underlying factors are associated with the operation of on track plant on London Underground, and the acceptance and maintenance of such plant for London Underground. As a consequence of this incident RAIB has made fourteen recommendations. These relate to the following areas:   Response to recommendations:   the manufacturer of the vehicles, and in particular the design, maintenance, and operation of the engineering unit including the braking system of the trailers the training of the staff involved the design, acceptance and approvals process for on-track plant and training on London Underground Ltd\u2019s railways the reporting of the incidents by the staff involved.

The train began to move before she was able to extract her coat, but the passenger was able to take the coat off, falling to the platform in the process. The RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause as the train operator not observing the situation on the platform as he went through the train starting process. Causal factors were: The investigation has established that an apparently disproportionate amount of instances of persons being dragged by closed doors occurs on the Northern Line when compared with the rest of the London Underground. London Underground Limited has issued a reminder to train operators of the correct procedure to be used when departing from a station, otherwise RAIB would have made a recommendation in this area. RAIB has recommended that London Underground investigates why the Northern Line experiences a greater than expected proportion of this type of incident and take any appropriate steps as a result of their investigation to reduce the rate on the Northern Line towards that on other LUL lines.

The patrolman was seriously injured, and has not yet been able to return to work. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause was that the patrolman had remained in the space between two railway lines as the train approached him. He had been warned of the approach of the train, and responded to that warning, but did not move to a safe place before the train arrived. A causal factor was that Network Rail had not prohibited work on the track at this location while trains were running, despite the limited visibility of approaching trains caused by the sharp curves nearby. Contributory factors included: The underlying cause was that inspection work was taking place on the track while trains were running. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made six recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail. Four of these recommendations address wide-ranging issues related to track worker safety and the quality of track inspections. The fifth and sixth recommendations propose that Network Rail revises its track inspection processes in order to improve staff safety.   Response to recommendations: the working practices of the gang of track workers the person in charge of the gang not confirming that the patrolman was clear of the track that person not having been given adequate guidance on making arrangements for protecting workers on the track this deficiency not being identified by Network Rail management.

The passenger train driver saw the locomotive ahead in time to stop without significant risk of collision. The RAIB investigation identified a mistake by the shunter, a member of the freight train staff, as the immediate cause of the incident. The causal factor was poor safety-critical communications between the train staff and signaller. Contributory factors included issues relating to the training and rostering of local staff and a conflict between the local instructions for the line and the rule book. RAIB has made two recommendations to English Welsh and Scottish Railway (EWS) and other freight operators. These recommendations concern instructions for operating single lines and the rostering of staff to locations. RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail and the operators who use the line. This recommendation concerns the operating instructions for this line. In addition, RAIB has made one recommendation targeted at the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB).

The operator and machine controller were unable to stop the RRV before it gathered speed. After travelling some four miles, the machine left the section of line that had been blocked to give protection from running trains and the operator, who was in the work basket, jumped clear. The machine ran for a further three miles before Network Rail staff were able to stop it west of Romford station. The operator was injured and required out-patient hospital treatment. In the incident at Birmingham Snow Hill, at around 02:30 hrs on 31 October 2007, a TD-18 RRV (another type of MEWP) was being removed from the track near Birmingham Snow Hill station when it ran away. It collided with a Basket 14 RRV parked 10-15 metres away. There were two persons in the work basket of the Basket 14 RRV and another was in the driving cab of the TD-18 RRV. They all managed to move clear before the collision and no-one was injured. The RAIB decided to conduct a joint investigation into these incidents as the similarities between the two \u2013 the vehicle types involved, the operations taking place and the parties involved \u2013 highlighted the likelihood of common safety learning. The RAIB has identified two causal factors for the incident at Brentwood, and one for the incident at Birmingham. All three concern the site practices involved in placing the RRVs on and off the track. The RAIB has also identified thre further contributory factors for each event. As a consequence of these incidents, the RAIB has targeted six recommendations at Network Rail, the owner of the infrastructure on which the RRVs were being used, to address causal and contributory factors. They concern procedures and training for on/off-tracking RRVs, the training given on Network Rail\u2019s competency scheme for machine controllers and a review of MEWPs to decide if modifications are required to prevent the possibility of an unbraked condition during on/off-tracking. \u00a0\n   Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.

He suffered serious injuries. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the track worker moved away from a line under lookout protection and toward an adjacent line on which a train was approaching. Causal factors were the position where the track worker was walking relative to the lookout, and him not informing the lookout of his intention to move to the other line. RAIB identified other factors that may have caused or contributed to the accident, including: Underlying issues concerned the workload of the local track managers, and the documentation of track inspections. RAIB has also made five observations about related matters that did not directly contribute to the accident. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made nine recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail. These cover the following areas: Response to recommendations: the relationships in the group of staff involved the sounding and reaction to the train horn the close proximity of bridge girders that restricted access. the responsibility of individuals to ensure that they receive adequate safety briefings the provision of automatic warning systems the use of safety helmets during track inspection the effectiveness of processes for confirming \u2018on-the-job\u2019 safety performance instruction on safe systems of work when trains move on adjacent lines documentation for track inspectors rebriefing of staff about limited clearance hazards.

The track worker was working alone and lifting track protection at the end of overnight maintenance work. The train was operated by First Great Western Trains. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the worker was walking on an open line without keeping an adequate look out for the trains. Causal factors were that he had confirmed that the line was clear to resume operations while he was still some distance from a permanent position of safety. He was also probably using an umbrella in the bad weather, which obscured his view of the approaching train. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made five recommendations, targeted at Network Rail. Since the accident, Network Rail have undertaken trials aimed at removing the need for on-track protection measures, which in some circumstances, would reduce the requirement for staff to access the track.

They are used during the maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure. The most common example is the wheeled excavator, but there are many other types. RAIB was concerned about the number of runaways involving road-rail vehicles and trailers and decided to carry out a class investigation to determine whether there are sufficient controls in place that should prevent the occurrence of runaways and whether these are properly implemented. RAIB\u2019s investigation identified that: During the course of the RAIB\u2019s investigation, Network Rail carried out its own investigation into the safety of road-rail vehicles and trailers. This did not specifically focus on runaways but has made recommendations on the design of new road-rail vehicles and the content of training courses that complement some of the recommendations made by RAIB in its report. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations aimed at Network Rail: Response to recommendations: the biggest proportion of runaways has occurred during the process whereby a road-rail vehicle transfers from road to rail, or rail to road. If not carried out correctly, an unbraked situation can arise on some road-rail vehicles other runaway incidents have occurred during braking where wet rails, possibly in combination with contamination of the rail head, have caused the wheels to slide and braking distances to be extended since the fatal accident at Tebay, there have been no further incidents of trailer runaways, although there have since been runaway incidents where trailers have been coupled to road-rail vehicles. Network Rail should use a systems engineering process to manage the specification, design, operation and maintenance of road-rail vehicles Network Rail should assess the safety of existing road-rail vehicles, using safety analysis methods, to determine whether the current technical and operational controls in place are sufficient to stop road-rail vehicles running away Network Rail should improve the level of reporting of incidents involving road-rail vehicles.

The driver had to take rapid evasive action to avoid being struck by another train travelling at speed on the adjacent line and threw himself to the ground as the train passed. No-one was hurt in the incident, and there was no damage to trains or infrastructure. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver of train 1B78 had not made arrangements for his own protection before going on the line. Causal factors were that the driver did not inform the signaller or request a blockage of the adjacent line before getting out of his cab, the signaller was unaware that the driver had left his cab and did not take any action to caution trains past the failed train or block the other line, the driver assumed that all trains were being cautioned past his failed train and the fitters did not make arrangements for their own protection as required.

On Wednesday 5 July, the leading bogie of the fifth coach of a different locomotive-hauled passenger train derailed at Millwood Bank. There were no injuries or significant damage to the track in either incident. The immediate cause of the Spout House Curve derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel, due to the combination of a vehicle fault and the track condition. There were two causal, several contributory and one underlying factor to the derailment. The immediate cause of the Millwood Bank derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel, due to a combination of vehicle, track and operational factors, which resulted in an excessive amount of vehicle sway and wheel unloading.

Whilst checking the brakes of one of the wagons, the driver elected to cross between that wagon and the wagon behind to reach the other side of the train. In doing so, he came into simultaneous contact with the live conductor rail and the buffer of the wagon, and was fatally injured. The immediate cause of the accident was the driver\u2019s leg coming into contact with a live conductor rail at the same time as his arm was in contact with the buffer, thus causing an electric shock. Causal factors were the driver\u2019s decision to pass between two wagons and a subsequent misjudgement, loss of balance or slip by the driver. There were two further possible causal factors, one contributory factor and four factors that may have influenced the behaviour of the driver. RAIB has made nine recommendations aimed at:   Response to recommendations: conductor rail safety; clarification of rules and publications; the training and briefing of staff; maintenance of rolling stock; and the long term development of simplified isolation arrangements.

The freight train was stopped by a Train Protection Warning System (TPWS) intervention. The driver immediately reset the equipment without speaking to the signaller, and continued his journey. The freight train was finally stopped by the driver at signal T160 at Purley Oaks station, which had been changed to show a red aspect. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The immediate cause of the Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) was that the freight train driver incorrectly assumed that the adjacent signal, which was green, applied to him. The main causal factors of the SPAD were the driver positioning his locomotive incorrectly, and that no specific stop marker had been provided. The immediate cause of the resetting of the TPWS incident was that the driver did not apply proper procedures after the intervention. The main causal factors were driver confusion, the incorrect assumption that an adjacent signal applied to his line, and the driver\u2019s lack of awareness and understanding of TPWS. RAIB has made five recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at: Response to recommendations: train shunting procedures at Purley station;\u00a0 training for TPWS procedures procedures for checking local \u2018method of work\u2019 instructions Railway Group standards on TPWS procedures safety procedures for shunters at Purley station.

The accident led to the destruction of the tractor and the death of its driver. The leading vehicle of the train was damaged in the impact, and minor injuries were sustained by the train driver and a passenger. The immediate cause of the accident was that the driver started to cross the railway line despite the miniature stop light being red and with a train approaching at speed. Casual factors were the possibility that the gates may have been left open prior to the tractors arrival, that the tractor driver may not have noticed the stop lights, and the limited visibility of the line from the tractor.

The trailing wheelset of the leading bogie derailed and the train travelled a further 1430m before coming to rest in an upright position. There were no injuries as a result of this derailment but track damage was sustained. The immediate cause of the derailment was the train running into material deposited on the track as a result of the cutting landslip. This failed due to the volume of water flowing through a concealed field drain into the slope, which was greater than usual due to the wet period over the preceding two weeks and excessive rain during the previous day. The root cause was that the field drain was hidden from view and therefore the infrastructure owner was unaware of it. RAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation.

{"title": "\n    Runaway incidents on Blackpool Transport Services tramway\n  ", "text": "This report covers three separate incidents. They were all associated with an abnormal method of operating the tramway. Single line working was taking place over a distance of about one mile because of line closure for track repairs. It was necessary for southbound trams to change direction twice at each end of this section to reach the opposite track. The first incident occurred on Monday 21 November 2005 at Talbot Square. Tram 644, travelling south, was leaving the single line section. The driver had just started the tram when the controller handle became detached. The driver was unable to replace the handle, and so he attempted to apply the emergency brake. This failed to act and the tram, which was not under power, continued to roll downhill, until the gradient levelled out and it came to a stop. The second incident was on Saturday 3 December 2005 at Gynn Square. The driver of tram 646, travelling south, left his cab to change ends for the reversal at the start of single line working. As he was walking through the tram it began to move and struck the barrier protecting the track repair works after rolling 5 metres. The driver then applied the emergency brake and the tram stopped. The third incident occurred on Saturday 10 December 2005, also at Gynn Square, and again involved tram 646. After completion of the reversing manoeuvre, the driver moved the tram forward a short distance, some 10 metres and then attempted to stop to allow a member of staff to alight. The tram did not respond to a service brake application, so the driver applied the emergency brake and the tram stopped. A different driver was involved in each incident. The immediate cause of the first incident was the poor condition of the tram controller housing. The immediate cause of the second and third incidents was the design of the tram controller housing.

{"title": "\n    Investigation into station pedestrian crossings \n  ", "text": "RAIB has reviewed the 97 pedestrian station crossings across the UK. Many are located on minor routes in rural locations. However, a number remain on busy lines, such as that located at Elsenham. RAIB carried out an analysis of the risks at station pedestrian crossings. The conclusions from this analysis are: Summary of fatal accident at Elsenham Station On Saturday 03 December 2005 two girls were struck by a fast moving train on the pedestrian level crossing at Elsenham station in Cambridgeshire. Both girls were killed. Immediately prior to the accident, the two girls had purchased tickets from the booking office on the east side of the line and were in the process of walking to the opposite platform. The immediate cause of the accident was the two girls stepping into the path of the approaching train, despite the continued display of a red light and the sounding of an audible alarm. It is likely that the accident occurred due to the girls\u2019 focus of attention on a train to Cambridge and their consequent failure to perceive the risk from trains in the opposite direction. Factors that contributed to the accident were the design of the crossing at Elsenham, which did not physically prevent users from opening the gate, and the crossing\u2019s warning signs and systems which did not deter the girls from stepping into the path of the train. In addition, it is possible the presence of a ticket machine on both platforms would have avoided the need for the girls to cross the line. RAIB has made eight recommendations regarding general station pedestrian crossing issues. Six are made to Network Rail, one to the Office of Rail Regulation and one to Station Operators. These recommendations relate to: RAIB has made two specific recommendations to Network Rail in relation to the crossing at Elsenham. These relate to: \u00a0\n  edit Response to recommendations:   The overall levels of individual risk are sufficiently high to justify a detailed risk assessment for each station pedestrian crossing. In cases where the individual risk to the most exposed user is found to be intolerable, immediate action should be taken to reduce the risk.\u00a0 The overall risk to society posed by station pedestrian crossings is unlikely to justify the expenditure needed to upgrade safety measures across the entire network. However, it is sufficient to justify a long term programme for the upgrading of station pedestrian crossings where it is reasonably practical to do so.\u00a0 the development of Network Rail\u2019s methods of risk management to address the particular hazards associated with station pedestrian crossings the development of a programme for upgrading station pedestrian crossings where it is reasonably practicable to do so the competence of Network Rail staff carrying out risk assessments the need for a review and update of design guidance and standards relating to the design of station pedestrian crossings taking into account a modern understanding of human factors and the potential of recent technological developments the enhancement of signage to remind users of the risk of a second train arriving the replacement of existing miniature warning lights with those utilising LED technology the provision of additional facilities to minimise the need for passengers to cross the line the development of a clearly defined and validated register of all foot crossings at stations on the network the locking of the pedestrian crossing gates before signals are cleared for the approach of trains;\u00a0 if necessary for the avoidance of delays, the construction of a footbridge.

The immediate cause of the incident was the presence of an extraneous washer in the drumswitch, causing an electrical defect preventing the proper application of the brakes. A contributing factor was the difficulty in examining the front section of the drumswitch, where the defect occurred, which may have led to the presence of the washer being missed. RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of its investigation: Response to recommendations: First Capital Connect (formerly Thameslink) and Southern to arrange for an inspection mirror to be used when examining the interior of the drumswitch. This recommendation has already been implemented. ALSTOM to review procedures to prevent loose material from interfering with the operation of the drumswitch RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Carlisle\n  ", "text": "On Monday 06 February 2006 a vehicle in an engineering train became derailed on a set of points at the north end of Carlisle station. All the wheels of a plough brake van at the rear of the train derailed. Minor damage was caused to the vehicle and the track, and there were no injuries. The immediate cause of the derailment was the ballast plough at the leading end of the brake van coming into contact with an adjacent running rail on the approach to the points. Causal factors were the failure to engage the locking keys when stowing the plough after its previous use, and the lack of any process to ensure locking keys are put in place before moving the plough brake van. RAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation: Response to recommendations: Two recommendations covering working procedures to prevent a recurrence of this incident\u00a0 Four recommendations to address poor practices that were observed during the investigation, but did not contribute to the derailment.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Cricklewood Curve \n  ", "text": "On Tuesday 31 January a freight train was traversing the Cricklewood Curve at 7.5 mph when two wagons derailed. The wagons overturned and started to slide down the embankment, but were held by their couplings to the rest of the train. There were no injuries as a result of the accident, but residents of flats at the foot of the embankment were evacuated as a precaution. The immediate cause of the derailment was a severe track twist, brought about by movement of the embankment at the site of repair works to address previous movements. Track maintenance staff had not appreciated the severity of the movement before the derailment and did not carry out remedial work. A risk assessment had identified embankment movement as the greatest risk during the works, but this was not fully considered by the Network Rail staff involved in planning the work.

The locomotive and the first three wagons were derailed. There were no injuries as a result of the accident, but some damage was caused to the wagons. The immediate cause of the accident was that the driver had a microsleep approaching the signal, and was only woken after the train had derailed beyond the signal. Two causal factors were that the driver was suffering from fatigue and the use of trap points as a measure to mitigate overruns. There were several contributory factors to the incident, including that the driver had intended to stop at the signal, rather than 20m short as required. He did this to avoid walking to the signal post telephone. RAIB has made ten recommendations as a result of its investigation. They cover: Response to recommendations: improvements to the management of fatigue; improving the safety of trap points; and re-positioning the signal post telephone.

The train was accelerating under power and could not be switched off by normal use of the controls. No other trains were involved and there were no injuries. The immediate cause of the accident was the train was returned to service with incorrectly connected wiring. This was because specified testing was not carried out after a wiring connection was altered during repairs. Contributing factors were the poor condition of cable identification numbers; the lack of a formal procedure for identifying cables when disconnected; the lack of a mandated test sequence; the testing staff\u2019s limited understanding of Class 313 systems; and the design of the traction control circuits. RAIB has made nine recommendations.

The blowback filled part of the footplate with flame for between 4 and 10 seconds. The locomotive driver suffered minor burns. The immediate cause of the accident was a loss of forward draft at a time that the firehole doors were open. The loss of draft was caused by the failure of a blastpipe base/saddle plate weld that was made undersized when the locomotive was originally built, allowing the blast pipe to move out of line. There were two causal factors, eight contributory factors and two underlying causes identified. RAIB has made nine recommendations as a result of its investigation. These cover: Response to recommendations: the size, inspection and repair of blast pipe base/saddle plate welds; provision for mechanical inspections when outsourcing work; assessment of hazards to train crew and public in the development of maintenance schedules; provision of first aid kits on minor railway locomotive footplates; annealing of copper blower feed pipes; and notification of incidents between the heritage sector and the mainline railway.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Trooperslane, Northern Ireland\n  ", "text": "On 23 April 2006 a Northern Ireland Railways engineering train, consisting of a tamper towing a ballast regulator, partially derailed at Trooperslane level crossing. The torque arm of the ballast regulator, which had become partially detached, hit the road surface panels of the crossing, and caused the derailment of the ballast regulator. The tamper did not derail, but there was damage to the track and level crossing itself. The immediate cause of the derailment was the torque arm lifting the ballast regulator off the track. The sole causal factor was the omission of a split pin from the upper torque arm securing pin. Contributory factors were the lack of a check process on the security of the torque arm, and the lack of a cross reference to the operations manual. The underlying cause of the derailment was the designed installation of two bolts where the torque arm meets the headstock of the regulator, where a single failure could cause catastrophic results.

As the train approached High Street Kensington, the driver realised that the wrong route had been set and stopped the train. A \u201cWrong Direction Move\u201d (WDM) was authorised to reverse the train a short distance so the route could be reset. However, the train did not stop at the authorised limit of the reversal, and was halted by the traction current being turned off. Once the traction current was recharged, the train then travelled to High Street Kensington and terminated 67 minutes late. Under slightly different circumstances this could have resulted in a collision with another train travelling in the opposite direction. However, with the protective measures taken during the incident the risk of such a collision was exceedingly low. There were no passenger injuries or damage to trains or infrastructure as a result of the incident. The immediate cause of the incident was the failure to correctly locate and identify the position of a signal during a WDM, resulting in the train reversing beyond the limit of the move. There were three causal factors and eight contributory factors to the incident. The underlying causes were inadequate managerial supervision of operating practices at Earls Court Control Room and at High Street Kensington station, and inadequate managerial understanding of the essential knowledge for staff operating in this area.

There were no injuries. Train services were disrupted and the line was closed until 18 January 2007 to enable repairs to be undertaken. The derailment was caused by debris on the track following the collapse of a wall immediately to the north of the railway. Contributory factors include heavier than average rainfall during December 2006 and January 2007, the poor drainage of the cutting slope and a reclassification of the cutting by Network Rail, which led to less frequent examinations. RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of this incident. Both relate to the management of wall structures and their infrastructure. RAIB are conducting a further investigation into the management of earthworks by Network Rail and issues relating to the earthworks at Kemble identified during this investigation will be taken forward as part of this further investigation.

The driver saw the debris and applied the emergency brake to slow the train, which stopped after 320 metres. None of the 413 passengers were injured but some needed assistance to reach the public highway. The first coach received substantial damage and some signalling equipment and track bonds required replacement. The immediate cause of the derailment was that two timber beams from a wall intended to prevent rock and soil spills had been displaced by a six-tonne root ball falling from the cutting side. There were three causal factors and four contributory factors related to the incident. The underlying cause was the lack of guidance in standards regarding root balls, and a backlog of earthworks examinations. RAIB has made seven recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve:   Response to recommendations: management of earthworks and vegetation risks from root balls two specific measures for Hooley cutting guidance for emergency services on accessing the railway and evacuating trains.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Grayrigg\n  ", "text": "A summary of the key points from the report is included below - The derailment and the subsequent response On Friday 23 February 2007 a Virgin West Coast train from London Euston to Glasgow derailed on 2B points at Lambrigg, near Grayrigg in Cumbria, while travelling at the authorised speed of 95mph (153 km/h). All nine carriages of the Class 390 Pendolino were derailed. There were at least 105 passengers and four crew on board. One passenger was fatally injured, 28 passengers, the train driver and one other crew member were seriously injured, and 59 passengers received minor injuries. The immediate cause of the derailment was the deterioration of 2B points through a combination of failures of the three stretcher bars, the lock stretcher bar, and their fastenings. This allowed the left-hand switch rail to move into an unsafe position close to its stock rail, without losing signalling detection. This came about as a result of a combination of three factors, which were: All three factors were necessary for the accident to occur. Contributory factors to the missed inspection included limited access times for maintenance of the West Coast Main Line at Grayrigg. Underlying factors included: In the thirty five years since the design of points used in 2B points was introduced there has been no previous catastrophic accident associated with the type of stretcher bars used in the design. Immediately after the accident Network Rail carried out an extensive check of points on their system. Although some defects were found there were no other stretcher bars in a similar state to that of 2B points, with all three factors present. As a result of the emerging findings from the investigation RAIB issued Urgent Safety Advice to the industry relating to: the inspection and maintenance of points on 6 June 2007; and the design of fastener systems, and their relevant to inspection processes, on 26 November 2007. This advice was sent to Network Rail, and also to Nexus, Manchester Metrolink, Northern Ireland Railways and London Underground, who all use a similar design of points. Network Rail has reported it is taking steps to improve the set up and inspection of points similar to 2B points, and has strengthened its management of these activities. New instructions have also been issued for the standardisation of track inspection. Network Rail is now carrying out work to assess the design of this type of points in order to assess any modifications to the design and maintenance/inspection regime. Potters Bar All of RAIB\u2019s investigations consider the relevance of previous similar occurrences. In this context RAIB considered the accident at Potters Bar in May 2002 where seven persons lost their lives. Whilst the type of points involved were different, a recommendation made by the Potters Bar Investigation Board (dated May 2003) identified the need for Network Rail to apply a risk-based approach to the management and maintenance of its points assets based on an understanding of the design and safety requirements. Network Rail had accepted the value of such an approach but did not consider its application to existing points with non-adjustable stretcher bars to be a priority. The train The train performed better than has been seen with earlier designs of trains in previous accidents. The passenger and crew areas were not significantly compromised; only two windows did not fully retain people within the carriages, the bogies did not separate form the carriage bodies. However, RAIB considers that safety could be improved by improving the design of seat mountings, and the lighting panels above the seats and has made further recommendations for the study of rail vehicles in \u2018roll over\u2019. The rescue The rescue of the passengers by the emergency services was swift, proportionate and well co-ordinated. However, RAIB has identified some areas where further improvements could be made. Recommendations RAIB has made twenty-nine safety recommendations. Twenty-one of these are directed at Network Rail. The primary long-term recommendations relate to a review of the design, inspection and maintenance of points, and particularly non-adjustable stretcher bar systems as used on 2B points. The short-term recommendations relate to mitigation of the risk from points in advance of the implementation of the longer- term recommendations. Further recommendations are targeted at Network Rail to address the underlying technical and managerial issues, and an issue of fatigue of staff. Eight recommendations are directed at other organisations. They primarily deal with issues relating to: the behaviour of the train as a consequence of the derailment; and the rescue services. The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the safety regulator for the railway industry, broadly supports the report and the findings. The responsibility of the ORR is to ensure that the recommendations that are directed at industry parties are duly taken into consideration and where appropriate acted upon. The ORR then has to report back to RAIB on the measures taken to implement the recommendations or explain why measures have not been taken. Response to recommendations: the mechanical failure of a bolted joint the incorrect set up the points a track inspection that was missed on 18 February 2007. Network Rail, perceived, based on the performance to date, that the risk associated with this design of S&C was low within Network Rail there was an incomplete understanding of the design, maintenance and inspection of the design of stretcher bars used in 2B points due to the limited application of a risk-based assessment.

The derailed wagon was dragged onto the bridge, where it, and other wagons that subsequently derailed, caused considerable damage to the bridge structure. There were no casualties in the derailment. RAIB\u2019s investigation identified the immediate cause of the incident was the right-hand leading wheel flange on wagon 16002 running over the rail head. This was caused by the leading right-hand suspension sticking (frictionally locking up), with the result that only the tip of the wheel flange was in contact with the rail.

The train approached and struck the partially open northern secondary gate at Lydney Town level crossing. The train continued through the crossing before being brought to a stand alongside Lydney Town station platform. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the driver of the train was unable to stop the train and struck the crossing gates. A causal factor was the excessive speed of the train, and contributory factors were the wet condition of the rails following recent heavy rain, the locomotive crew\u2019s lack of training and experience in controlling this type of train in these conditions, the failure of equipment that warned the level crossing operators that a train was approaching, and the lack of any system for informing the train crew that this equipment was not working.

As the train departed the man ran, and then was pulled along the platform, before falling down the gap between the train and platform edge. The man sustained serious injuries to his left arm and hand. The immediate cause of the accident was the train pulling away with the injured man\u2019s coat trapped in the door. Contributing factors were the actions of the injured person before the train doors closed; the design of the train\u2019s doors; the position of the train in relation to the CCTV monitors on the platform and the design of these monitors; and the presence of other passengers on the platform. RAIB has made six recommendations aimed at: Response to recommendations: driver training; design of CCTV monitors; the design of Class 365 train doors; positioning of CCTV monitors at Huntingdon station; safety standards for train doors; improved signage and controls for emergency exits at doors on Class 365 trains.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Santon \n  ", "text": "At about 10:48 hrs on 25 January 2008, the tenth wagon of freight train 6M49 - the 09:02 hrs service from Immingham Docks to Rugeley Power Station - derailed on a plain line at Santon, between Wrawby Junction and Foreign Ore Branch Junction, Scunthorpe. The front four wheels of the wagon, which was loaded with coal, left the rails, and the train continued for just over a mile before stopping. No one was injured in this derailment, but there was considerable damage to the railway infrastructure and the line was subsequently closed for over a week while repairs were carried out. RAIB\u2019s investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the front right-hand wheel of the wagon rode over the rail as the train traversed a left hand curve at Santon. This was because the load on this wheel was significantly reduced by the combined effect of a number of track geometry faults close to each other. The local Network Rail inspection and maintenance regime had not detected that these faults, which had been addressed by maintenance action three months prior to the derailment, had re-occurred. The track geometry was deteriorating rapidly because of considerable amounts of water running in the formation beneath it. No-one reported or responded to the signs of water and poor drainage around the point of derailment. The load on the first wheel to derail was also reduced by coal being unevenly loaded in the wagon. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made eight recommendations targeted at the infrastructure owner Network Rail relating to track inspection and maintenance standards, track drainage at Santon, the identification of the exact location of rapid track deterioration, the monitoring of track repair quality and guidance about action to take if water affects the track. One further recommendation to address the uneven loading of the wagon is targeted at Freightliner Group Limited. \u00a0\n   Response to recommendations:   RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

The train derailed and continued on for 170 metres. The cab of the train was severely damaged due to it colliding with the debris from the footbridge. The driver of the train, the guard and one of the passengers were taken to hospital. The guard and the passenger were released later that day and the driver early the next morning. The cab of the tipper lorry was also severely damaged; however, its driver escaped injury. The immediate cause of the accident was that the train was unable to stop before it hit the debris from the footbridge. The footbridge was demolished because the raised body of the tipper lorry collided with it. The driver forgot to fully lower the body of the tipper because he was distracted from his normal routine by having to unlock the cab passenger door to allow access for a member of railway staff. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made recommendations targeted at Network Rail that relate to: RAIB has also recommended that the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) examines designing trains to mitigate the consequences of derailment.   Response to recommendations:   the assessment of risks during transit operation of road vehicles on their land near to the running line a review of arrangements to ensure that correct protection is used when undertaking work on or near the running line.

The child sustained minor injuries. The train was travelling at approximately 20 mph (32 km/h) at the time of the incident. The accident happened because the carriage doors are fitted with internal handles. The carriage was of Danish origin, and the NVR is the only UK operator of such carriages. The child was probably able to open both the door deadlock and slam lock handles. There were no warning signs about the risk posed by the door handles. RAIB has made one recommendation to NVR; the NVR have taken action. The recommendation relates to measures to reduce the risk of accidental opening of doors on their ex-Danish carriages and any others in their fleet employing internal door handles, such as modifying the handles and posting warning signs. RAIB has also notified the European Rail Agency of its findings so that other railways in Europe that might use carriages with these door handles are aware of the risks from them.

Fifty minutes later the brakes on the two separated wagons ceased to hold them against the gradient, and they ran slowly towards St Pancras for about 200 - 300 metres, then reversing before coming to rest about 140 metres from where they had started. Causal and contributory factors included that the driver and signaller were not following the rule book requirements concerning trains where couplings had broken or had a missing tail lamp, the condition of the brakes fitted to the runaway wagons, and the breakage of the coupling because part of the material it was made from was outside specification. RAIB has made six recommendations directed at EWS, and one at Network Rail. These relate to drivers\u2019 actions following a train division, the maintenance of wagons, reducing the number of EWS train divisions occurring and improving the way that signallers\u2019 actions in response to accidents and incidents are practiced and assessed.

There were no serious injuries caused by the derailment, but 20 passengers received medical treatment. All 520 passengers were evacuated from the train along the tunnel to Mile End station. The derailment also caused some damage to the first two carriages of the train, to the track and to one signal. The immediate cause of the incident was a roll of fire-resistant blanket, approximately 1.8m long, lying across one rail. The blanket had been stored in a passage the previous night and weighted down, but the wind from passing trains had caused it to unfurl and fall onto the line. There were four causal factors and four contributory factors related to the incident. The underlying cause was the lack of a comprehensive risk analysis being performed to support the use of fire-resistant blankets. RAIB has made five recommendations as a result of this incident.

{"title": "\n    Management of existing earthworks\n  ", "text": "RAIB has previously investigated incidents at Oubeck in November 2005, Moy in November 2005 and Kemble on 15 January 2007 where earthworks slope failures resulted in passenger train derailments. These incidents were in part caused by a recent period of localised extreme weather, deficiencies in the performance of the local drainage systems at the site and surface water standing on, or flowing from, adjacent non-railway land. As a result RAIB decided to investigate Network Rail\u2019s overall process for the management of its earthworks. There has been no fatality attributed, either directly or indirectly, to an earthworks failure since 1995. Though the approach to earthworks management taken by Network Rail is comparable or better than other industries with similar type of earthworks, RAIB\u2019s investigations have highlighted some inconsistencies in the application of earthworks management systems across Network Rail. The investigation sought to address a number of questions, including:  Does the available evidence indicate an increasing number of safety related incidents occurring as a result of earthworks failures? Are the earthworks management systems used by Network Rail appropriately identifying the safety risk? How do the processes and systems used by Network Rail compare with those used by the owners of other, similar infrastructure? Is there any evidence of climate change affecting the behaviour of earthworks and if so how is Network Rail addressing this? Within this report RAIB has made four recommendations targeted at Network Rail which relate to work by them to further understand the accuracy and effectiveness of their inspection and assessment processes in mitigating the risk from earthworks failure, improving the consistency of application of good practice seen during this investigation, the provision of guidance to staff in regard to the railways\u2019 neighbours and the alignment of internal procedures which define the actions to be taken in adverse weather.

The train consisted of a Class 56 locomotive hauling 20 FEA-B type flat wagons and was running at approximately 75 mph (121 km/h). The detached containers blocked the running lines and caused damage to overhead line equipment (OLE) and the track. The second incident occurred at around 03:15 hrs on the same day when five empty containers were blown from freight train 4S83, while it was travelling on the down line of the WCML adjacent to Hardendale Quarry, between Tebay and Penrith. This train consisted of two Class 86 locomotives hauling 20 container flat wagons of mixed types, including 10 FEA-B wagons, and was also running at approximately 75 mph (121 km/h). The detached containers were blown from the rearmost four FEA-B wagons of the train. They blocked running lines and caused damage to the OLE and track. The immediate cause of the incidents was the overturning and detachment of the empty freight containers, due to the aerodynamic forces resulting from a combination of high cross winds and train speeds. There were several causal and contributory factors and two underlying factors. The causal factors were: As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made ten recommendations, targeted as follows:   Response to recommendations:   the high cross wind speeds at both sites both trains were travelling at close to their permitted maximum speed of 75 mph (121 km/h) the containers which detached were empty the lack of overturning retention provided by the FEA-B wagon\u2019s fold-down spigots, because the spigots had not been designed in accordance with the appropriate standard the wagon manufacturer had not appreciated the function and operating principles of the spigots the lack of explicit warning in the design standard covering spigots, about the use of inboard hinges for fold-down spigots the lack of checks on the spigots by the vehicle acceptance body during the vehicle approvals process the lack of a mandatory UK design Railway Group Standard (RGS) relating to load retention devices the lack of use of guidance documentation during the vehicle approvals process the freight operators not identifying that the FEA-B wagon\u2019s fold-down spigots could not secure containers from overturning. Freight operators: five recommendations relating to operating wagons fitted with UIC spigots in windy conditions, checking compliance of spigots on existing wagons, reviewing maintenance documentation and developing a long term solution for wagons fitted with non-compliant spigots The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR): one recommendation relating to clarification of the European freight wagon standard, so that in future designers are made aware of the operating principles of spigots and the dangers of fold-down spigots Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB): three recommendations relating to UK standards for load retention devices and minimum container weights and a review of the implementation of the vehicle certification process Network Rail: one recommendation to review the compatibility of the wind speeds and durations at which actions are taken to protect the network with the design requirements for trains in relation to overturning.

A \u2018low ride\u2019 road rail excavator is a machine that shares its weight between its road and rail wheels during on track operation; the rail wheels guide the machine along the track while the road wheels provide the means of traction and braking. The excavator derailed after its operator transferred weight from its rail to its road wheels. He did this because the track gradient and overloaded wagons increased the amount of traction he required, while the traction available to him was reduced by: As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made four recommendations. One recommendation is targeted at the new owners of the road rail excavator, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, and requires it to maintain and operate the excavator so that it distributes its weight appropriately between road and rail wheels. The remaining recommendations are targeted at Northern Ireland Railways and require them to identify and eliminate or mitigate the factors that affect the safe operation of road rail vehicles, brief this process to the members of staff who have responsibility for the safety of vehicle movements on track, and ensure road rail vehicles and their associated wagons are inspected and assessed before permitting operation on their infrastructure. \u00a0\n   Response to recommendations:   rainwater that had reduced adhesion between the rubber road tyres and the steel rails uncompensated tyre wear that transferred weight, originally applied through the road wheels, to the rail wheels.

Of the four wagons that derailed, two overturned and one of these hit and demolished a 10 metre section of parapet wall. The wall fell approximately 20 metres onto private ground below, severely damaging an unoccupied, parked car. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the wheel of one of the wagons rode over the rail at the location of a severe track twist. Causal factors were that the track geometry was not compliant with industry standards, and that the track twist had not been detected or corrected. The underlying factor was that Network Rail did not identify the contribution that voids under the sleepers were making to the derailment risk in this area, and did not implement measures to control the risk. RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of this accident. These concern the design and maintenance of the track near Moor Street station, and methods to improve the identification of voids under sleepers. One further recommendation is targeted at DB Schenker Rail (UK) Ltd, the train operator, which was trading as English, Welsh & Scottish Railway Ltd at the time of the accident.

The pedestrian was using the crossing - which is also a bridleway - to reach the south-bound platform with the intention of catching a local train to Oxford. The train was travelling at 90 mph / 145 kph and sounded its horn on the approach to the crossing. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was the pedestrian stepping onto the crossing and into the path of the train. Possible causal factors were the pedestrian mistaking a fast train for the stopping service which was due at about the same time, or being unaware of the train\u2019s approach due to an obstruction created by a poorly sited fence. A contributory factor related to the way in which crossing inspections were undertaken which meant that the need to improve visibility for crossing users was not recognised.

The driver of the coach was injured as he attempted to arrest the movement of the coach. There were no other injuries, although the position of passengers behind the coach immediately before it moved gave rise to the potential for injury. The RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause as the coach not being sufficiently restrained against movement. It has not been possible to establish with certainty the circumstances which led to this situation, but the absence of the correct chocks and the difficulty of the shuttle crew in confirming the state of the controls of a road vehicle possibly contributed to the cause of the accident.

There was no damage to the train or the infrastructure. The immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian fell to the ground on the crossing and was unable to avoid being struck by the approaching train. The RAIB\u2019s investigation identified that causal factors were that the pedestrian did not stop, look and listen before stepping onto the crossing, the surface of the crossing was slippery and Network Rail had not added a non-slip surface to this crossing, although this had been considered by Railtrack in 1996 and requested by Her Majesty\u2019s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) in 2005.

The train driver saw the mobility scooter but was unable to stop the train before it reached the crossing. However, the mobility scooter moved clear of the crossing before the train arrived, and there were no injuries or damage. The immediate cause of the incident was that the crossing keeper mistakenly believed that an indicator showed \u2018train in section\u2019 for a train that had already passed over the level crossing, and did not appreciate that there was in fact a train approaching the level crossing from Attleborough station. In addition, vegetation alongside the line obstructed the visibility towards Attleborough. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made recommendations targeted at Network Rail. They relate to the need for it to review its procedures for the operation of Poplar Farm crossing, to identify improvements that would reduce the possibility of errors being made in the operation of the crossing. The recommendations also propose that Network Rail should revise its current method of crossing inspections to take account of local factors relating to the method of operation of crossings; and changes in traffic levels.

This happened in the vicinity of New Southgate, around 6 \u00be miles (10.8 km) north of King\u2019s Cross, at a closing speed of approximately 196 mph (314 km/h). Both trains were class 43 High Speed Trains (HSTs). The side of train 1A16 suffered significant damage, although the passenger compartment was not penetrated. All doors and windows remained intact. A number of passengers and crew were shaken and one passenger reported suffering a minor eye injury as a result of glass-fibre particles entering a vestibule through a part open window. The RAIB investigation identified that the luggage van door was pulled off mountings by aerodynamic forces as the two trains passed, the door had been put into service with a faulty component and for other undetermined reasons was unlocked. The investigation also established that there was no procedure in place to inform maintenance staff how to deal with a luggage van door that they could not repair. The operator of both trains, National Express East Coast, did not appreciate the risk associated with HST luggage van doors, in part because the lessons of previous incidents were not incorporated into current processes. This situation arose as part of a general loss of awareness of the criticality of set-up and maintenance of luggage van doors within the industry. As a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations addressed to National Express East Coast, and other operators and owners of trains with the type of door involved in the incident. These are relate to:   Response to recommendations:   luggage van door set-up and maintenance procedures for monitoring the frequency of luggage van doors being found open in traffic and the need to corrective action procedures relating to what safety precautions should be put in place before a train can enter service with defective equipment.

This debris had fallen from the bridge following the failure of supports at one end of the bridge deck. This failure caused a sudden jolt which shook the deck, dislodging the concrete planks. Damage to the train was minor and there were no injuries. However, concern over the stability of the bridge resulted in the signaller stopping all other trains in the vicinity. It was some hours before the safety of the structure could be assured, and services did not recommence until the following day. The immediate cause of the accident was the concrete planks falling from the partly-completed deck of the bridge onto the track below. This was because of: Since the incident, the bridge has been repaired and completed. As a consequence of this accident, the RAIB has made seven recommendations, targeted at Network Rail, Health and Safety Executive (Hse), London Underground Limited, Rail for London, the Heritage Rail Association, the Light Rail Engineering Group, Northern Ireland Railways and National Express East Anglia, the operator of the train. These recommendations cover the following areas: \u00a0 \n   Response to recommendations:   the unexpected movement of the bridge deck which was positioned on a steep gradient and inadequately restrained an inadequately planned operation to restore the deck to its correct position. This involved modification to the temporary supports and caused them to become unstable the decision to omit a recommended connection between individual pre-cast concrete planks, which allowed the planks to fall from the deck when it was exposed to a large jolt, and fall onto the track.

{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at Morden Hall Park footpath crossing\n  ", "text": "At 14:37 hrs on Saturday 13 September 2008, a tram travelling from Wimbledon to New Addington on the London Tramlink system collided with a 21-year-old male cyclist at Morden Hall Park footpath crossing, between Morden Road and Phipps Bridge tram stops. The tram was travelling at about 62 km/h (39 mph) at the moment that it struck the cyclist, who was thrown to the ground and sustained injuries from which he later died. The RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the cyclist rode onto the crossing without looking at the approaching tram. Causal factors were that the cyclist may have been wearing headphones which prevented him hearing the audible warnings sounded by the tram driver, and that the layout of the approach to the crossing did not encourage cyclists to look towards eastbound trams. The investigation found that a possible contributory factor was that the risks created by the way in which Morden Hall Park and other foot crossings on the London Tramlink system were being used had not been assessed by the infrastructure manager since the tramway opened. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made one recommendation targeted at Tramtrack Croydon Ltd (trading as London Tramlink), the owner and infrastructure manager, to modify footpath crossings on their system where appropriate. Following the accident, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) issued an Improvement Notice requiring Tramtrack Croydon Ltd to assess the risks to users at footpath crossings on its system, and identify any further actions required to reduce risk.

The RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver of the train did not brake his train sufficiently early to stop before the crossing when the driver\u2019s indicator at the crossing (the DCI) was showing a flashing red aspect. The investigation concluded that driver did not apply his brakes until 9.7 seconds after passing the special speed restriction board for the crossing, anticipating that the driver\u2019s crossing indicator would change from a flashing red aspect to a flashing white aspect. It also concluded that the driver may have been fatigued, or distracted by the presence of two other drivers in the cab with him. The investigation revealed that the settings of the driver\u2019s crossing indicators on other similar crossings on the Cambrian lines of Network Rail may have conditioned the driver to expect flashing red aspects to continue after passing the special speed restriction board, and that the railway industry Rule Book does not give explicit guidance as to what to do with regard to the speed of a train if the driver\u2019s crossing indicator displays a flashing red aspect when the driver passes the special speed restriction board. Although not a direct factor, as a flashing red aspect is a normal condition, the breakdown of an unorthodox method of carrying out maintenance of the crossing resulted in the flashing red aspect being displayed to the driver, and the crossing not operating. As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made eight recommendations, targeted at Network Rail, Arriva Trains Wales Ltd (the operator of the train involved) and the Rail Safety and Standards Board. These concern the design of Llanbadarn level crossing, modifications to other crossings that display aspects similar to that which may have affected the driver\u2019s actions, Rule Book amendments and briefings to drivers and the maintenance procedures for automatic level crossings on the Cambrian lines.

Damage was caused to private property, to the derailed train and to the infrastructure of the railway. The freight train\u2019s braking performance prior to derailing was much reduced from that which would normally be expected. The train\u2019s driver was unaware of this reduction prior to attempting to brake the train on the approach to Carrbridge. A combination of factors led to the derailment occurring. These included: RAIB has made four recommendations. These are: Response to recommendations: snow and ice ingress reducing the effectiveness of the train\u2019s brakes the way that the driver of the train applied the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions on steep climbing gradients the train ploughing into and/or disturbing lying snow during the journey from Inverness to Carrbridge; and the presence of deep lying snow close to the railway line. to freight operating companies, in conjunction with the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), concerning changes to the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions on steep climbing gradients to Network Rail, relating to the assessment of risk at locations including steep gradients when trains are operating over them in snowy conditions to Network Rail, relating to the assessment of risk when deep lying snow is left close to railway lines following the prolonged use of a certain type of snow clearance equipment to Network Rail, concerning the assessment of risk should trains fail to stop when requested to do so at the signal controlling the approach to Carrbridge from Inverness. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Fatal accident at Moreton-on-Lugg\n  ", "text": "On 16 January 2010, a collision occurred between a passenger train and two cars at the level crossing at Moreton-on-Lugg, near Hereford. The front-seat passenger in one of the cars was fatally injured. The driver was seriously injured and detained in hospital. The two occupants of the other car attended hospital as a precaution. There were no casualties on the train, which did not derail. The level crossing is controlled from the adjacent signal box. The cause of the accident was that the signaller raised the barriers in error when the train was approaching and too close to be able to stop before reaching the level crossing. He had just been involved in an absorbing telephone call that had interrupted his normal task of monitoring the passage of the train. As a result he believed that the train had already passed over the crossing. There was no safeguard in the signalling system to prevent this from happening. There was no plan to fit such a safeguard, and no industry requirement to formally consider the safety benefits of one. RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. They include assessing the need for additional engineered safety measures at level crossings like Moreton-on-Lugg and targeted improvements to its processes for managing risk at level crossings, and for determining when it should bring signalling assets into line with latest safety standards. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Incident at Romford station\n  ", "text": "At about 07:25 hrs on 4 February 2010, a quantity of stone ballast fell from the bottom doors of a wagon in a freight train, running from Acton, west London, to Ipswich, as it passed through Romford station in Essex at about 59 mph (95 km/h). Stones bounced onto the station platform, and struck three people, two of whom subsequently required treatment for minor injuries.  The immediate cause of the incident was that ballast fell through an open door on one of the wagons and ricocheted off the track onto the platform. The causal factors were: the leading bottom discharge doors on wagon 14513 were open when the train left Acton and when it passed through Romford; the position of the lock handles on the PGA wagon can lead staff to believe that the doors are closed and locked when the doors are actually partially or fully open: the design of the mechanism permits this condition to exist. RAIB has made five recommendations to the company that operated the freight train, relating to modifications to the type of wagon involved in the incident, instructions and methods for checking that doors are properly closed, training and competence of staff, and the management of safety.   Response to recommendations:   RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.

{"title": "\n    Passenger train derailment near East Langton\n  ", "text": "On 20 February 2010, at around 15:49 hrs, a seven-car Meridian diesel multiple unit passenger train derailed by one axle of the fourth vehicle, while travelling on the Midland Main Line near East Langton. The train was travelling at a speed of 94 mph (151 km/h) when the derailment occurred, and it subsequently ran for a distance of approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) before it stopped. The train remained upright during the derailment and did not foul the adjacent line. There were no injuries among the 190 passengers and 5 crew who were on board the train, but there was damage to the track and the train, including loss of diesel fuel. The immediate cause of the derailment was the complete fracture of the powered trailing axle of the leading bogie on the fourth vehicle. The fracture occurred underneath the gear-side output bearing of the final drive and was caused by this bearing stiffening up so that it could no longer rotate normally. When this happened the axle spun within the inner race of the bearing to which it is normally tightly fitted. The consequent generation of a large amount of frictional heat between the axle and bearing resulted in the axle being locally heated to a high temperature and weakened to the point it could no longer carry its normal loading. Key evidence about the condition of the bearing and its fit onto the axle was destroyed in the failure, making it impossible to determine with certainty, the precise sequence of events leading to the bearing becoming stiff in rotation. The RAIB investigation has interpreted the available evidence in order to identify the most likely cause of the failure from the possible causes. RAIB concluded that the most likely cause of the bearing failure which preceded the overheating of the axle was a loose fit between the gear-side output bearing and axle. RAIB has made four recommendations. Two recommendations relate to reviewing the design and overhaul procedures for final drive gearboxes on Meridians and other rolling stock. They also cover consideration of the detection of overheating output bearings in order to mitigate risk to persons resulting from a failure of the output bearings, regardless of the cause. A third recommendation relates to the oil sampling regime used for the Meridian fleet and the fourth relates to the provision of practical, simulation based alarm handling training for drivers and train crew.

The front and lower side of the train were damaged by the impact and the driver of the train was slightly injured. None of the passengers on the train or workers on the site were injured. The accident was caused by a combination of factors including: RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail, the owners of the infrastructure. The recommendations relate to independent checking of safe systems of work, supervision of staff at the Saltley infrastructure maintenance delivery unit (IMDU), the training and assessment of existing staff for safety leadership roles and changes to operating procedures. A recommendation regarding understanding the causes of rule violation made in a previous report in 2006 was also relevant here. Response to recommendations: the unsafe system of work adopted for the maintenance work did not comply with the rule book or Network Rail\u2019s procedures the supervisor in charge of the relaying work was not adequately managed and was not challenged over his unsafe method of work the lack of effective review of the safe system of work at the planning and implementation stages.

{"title": "\n    Track worker struck at Cheshunt Junction\n  ", "text": "At 11:44 hrs on 30 March 2010 train 2B13, a passenger service running from Stansted Airport to London Liverpool Street, travelling at about 30 mph (48 km/h), struck a member of railway staff at Cheshunt Junction in Hertfordshire. The person who was struck was one of a team of eight people carrying out maintenance work on the track, and he was seriously injured. There was no damage to the train or infrastructure. The investigation has identified that the track worker who was struck did not move to a position of safety and remained in the path of the train as it passed through the junction. The track worker had not expected the train to follow the route which took it onto the line on which he was working. No satisfactory safe system of work had been established, and staff did not always move to a position of safety when the lookout warned that trains were approaching. RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail relating to reducing the risk of working at junctions, and the behaviour of staff working at locations with extended sighting of approaching trains.

Five wagons loaded with aggregate ran away from a siding for 890 metres before two of them were derailed at trap points. The wagons had been left in the siding three days earlier. The runaway was caused by ineffective handbrakes on the wagons. The investigation found deficiencies in the maintenance plan for the wagons and raised a concern about the way in which safety related information from other industries was brought to the attention of the rail industry. RAIB has made six recommendations, relating to operating instructions, maintenance plans, distribution of safety related information from other industries and improved brake testing.

{"title": "\n    Derailment of engineering train, Piccadilly Line\n  ", "text": "On 12 May 2010, the leading wheelset of a locomotive that was hauling an engineering train derailed when it was travelling westbound between Gloucester Road and Earl\u2019s Court stations on the Piccadilly Line of the London Underground system. As a result of the derailment, the locomotive and infrastructure were damaged and the driver of the engineering train reported suffering from trauma. The westbound Piccadilly Line was closed between Gloucester Road and Earl\u2019s Court stations until the start of the passenger service the following day while the locomotive was re-railed and infrastructure repairs were undertaken. The derailment occurred because the track was not able to maintain gauge within safe limits as the train passed over it. A combination of factors led to this situation occurring, including: RAIB has made nine recommendations. The recommendations include changes to how data from asset inspection equipment is presented, an analysis of the tasks involved in track patrolling and inspecting, changes relating to the training and assessment of track patrollers and inspectors, improvements to assurance processes and consideration of the use of available technologies that can assist track patrollers and inspectors in recording and classifying track faults.   Response to recommendations: the non-identification and misclassification of track faults which led to those faults not being rectified no action being taken in response to the identification of dynamic wide gauge at the location of the derailment in the previous months there were insufficient staff to maintain the track in good condition the Piccadilly Line team within Tube Lines was mainly focused on managing safety faults and had not identified the safety risks from combined groups of less serious faults.

{"title": "\n    Accident at Falls of Cruachan, Argyll\n  ", "text": "At 20:55 hrs on Sunday 6 June 2010, the 18:20 hrs train from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban struck a boulder that had fallen onto the track just west of the station at Falls of Cruachan, in the Pass of Brander, on the line from Crianlarich to Oban. The boulder lifted up the front coach of the two-coach train and derailed it to the left and down an embankment. The leading bogie of the rear coach came to a stand supported by the boulder with the rear bogie still on the track. Of the 64 passengers and three crew on the train, eight of the passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The boulder had fallen down the cutting slope onto the railway from within the railway boundary. It had become insecure due to the growth of tree roots around it, which gradually prised it from its stable position, and soil erosion from normal rainfall. Network Rail\u2019s earthworks management system applied to cutting slopes had not identified the hazard of loose boulders in the area that the accident occurred. RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to the management of earthworks. These include: A further recommendation has been made relating to the prevention of lighting diffusers and other saloon panels on rolling stock becoming displaced during accidents.   Response to recommendations: improving the clearance of vegetation growing on earthworks so that hazards to the safety of railway operation can be identified improvements to the collection of slope data so that a full appreciation of the condition of slopes is obtained improvements to the process for the implementation of remediation works to prevent future earthworks failures.

{"title": "\n    Runaway and collision near Raigmore\n  ", "text": "At about 23:39 hrs on 20 July 2010, a machine operator was placing a road-rail excavator onto the railway near Drumrosach farm, near Raigmore, Inverness. As the machine was being placed on the track it began to run down the gradient. The people who were in attendance were unable to stop the machine before it gathered speed. The machine ran for 0.88 miles (1.41 km) with the machine operator on board, and then collided, at between 40 and 50 mph (64 to 80 km/h), with the rear of a stationary freight train which was standing on the bridge over the line that runs between Inverness and Aberdeen. In the collision, the machine operator was thrown out of the cab and landed on top of the rear wagon of the freight train, sustaining serious injuries. The excavator was derailed by all wheels and the leading axle of the rear wagon became derailed. Both the excavator and the freight wagon sustained damage. RAIB\u2019s investigation identified that the excavator was placed into an unbraked condition while being manoeuvred onto the track. This is likely to have occurred due to a combination of operator errors and a transient single point failure of the machine\u2019s control system. The machine operator was then unable to slow, derail or stop the excavator as it ran away. RAIB has made four recommendations relating to modifications to the design of the excavator, a review of the safety requirements that are specified for this type of machine, and a review of the training of people who control this type of machine on site.

{"title": "\n    Runaway at Highgate\n  ", "text": "Shortly before 07:00 hrs on Friday 13th August 2010, an engineering train ran away along part of the Northern Line of London Underground. The train consisted of a self-propelled diesel-powered unit designed for re-profiling worn rails. It had been working between Highgate and Archway stations on the southbound line during the night of 12/13 August. At the end of grinding operations that night, the crew of the unit found that they were unable to restart its engine to travel away from the site of work. An assisting train, consisting of a six-car train of the 1995 stock used for passenger services on the Northern line, was sent to the rescue of the grinding unit. The assisting train was coupled to the grinding unit by means of an emergency coupling device, and the braking system of the grinding unit was de-activated to allow it to be towed. The combined trains then set out to run to East Finchley station. At about 06:42 hrs, after passing through Highgate station, the coupling device fractured and the grinding unit began to run back down the gradient towards central London. The crew of the grinding unit, who had no means of re-applying the brake, jumped off the unit as it passed through Highgate station. It then ran unattended for about four miles, passing through a further six stations, and came to rest near Warren Street station about sixteen minutes later. LUL control room staff took action to clear trains away from the path of the runaway unit. No-one was hurt. There was some damage to the grinding unit, and points at Mornington Crescent station were damaged when the unit ran through them. The emergency coupling broke because it was not strong enough for the duties it was intended to perform, and had been inadequately designed and procured. RAIB has made seven recommendations to London Underground Ltd, covering the processes for introducing new engineering equipment, review of existing equipment, investigation of incidents, training of staff, the operation of unbraked vehicles, and the quality assurance processes used by LUL and its associated companies.

The collision caused the train to derail. Several passengers and the conductor on the train were injured in the collision; four passengers and the train driver were seriously injured. RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the driver of the road tanker did not use the telephone provided before driving onto the crossing, although it was a requirement to do so. The company employing the road tanker driver had not been briefed by Anglian Water (to whom they were contracted) on how their staff could use Sewage Works Lane   safely. The investigation also found that the long waiting times that road vehicle drivers sometimes experienced before being given permission to use the crossing at Sewage Works Lane led to a high level of non-compliance with the correct procedures for its use. Network Rail\u2019s processes relating to misuse at user worked crossings did not identify this issue and Network Rail\u2019s procedures for responding to misuse and near-miss incidents on user worked crossings were unclear and sometimes not complied with. Network Rail\u2019s data gathering exercises at Sewage Works Lane   (for the purposes of risk assessment) were characterised by errors and omissions and the amount of time devoted by Network Rail staff to analysing the results from the risk assessments and considering possible risk mitigation measures was limited. No single person or team in Network Rail had a complete understanding of the risk at Sewage Works Lane  . RAIB\u2019s investigation has also found that the design of the tables in the type of train involved at Sewage Works Lane may have exacerbated the consequences of the accident and that the signage at Sewage Works Lane   presented information in an unclear manner. RAIB has made six recommendations, covering the following areas: The Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) has implemented research into signs at private railway crossings, thus obviating the need for the RAIB to make a recommendation to address this issue. Response to recommendations: improving safety at Sewage Works Lane  \n reminders to business users at user worked crossings of their responsibility to brief contractors on how to use such crossings safely Network Rail\u2019s management of risk at crossings where there are long waiting times for road users improvements in Network Rail\u2019s processes for gathering information at user worked crossings changes to Network Rail\u2019s overall approach to the management of risk at level crossings a review of the crashworthiness performance of the tables in the type of train involved in the accident.

{"title": "\n    Uncontrolled freight train run-back, Shap Summit\n  ", "text": "In the early hours of 17 August 2010, a northbound freight train was travelling uphill on the West Coast Main Line between Tebay and Shap Summit in Cumbria. At 02:04 hrs the train slowed to a stop and then ran back until the driver braked and the train came to a stand at 02:09 hrs. During the run-back the train reached a maximum speed of 51 mph (82 km/h) and travelled 2.2 miles (3.5 km). The incident caused no injuries or damage; however the consequences could have been worse. If the driver had not braked when he did, the rear of the train would have travelled over a turnout into Tebay sidings at an excessive speed, which may have led to derailment, damage and obstruction of the adjacent line on which trains travel south. The investigation found that DB Schenker\u2019s train driver, who was working the first of a series of night shifts, was probably fatigued and not sufficiently alert at the time of the incident. It also found that although DB Schenker had used a recommended mathematical model and industry guidance to plan the shift, the driver had been exposed to a work pattern that was likely to induce high levels of fatigue. The report concludes that the mathematical model adopted by most of the rail industry is likely to under-predict the probability that high levels of fatigue will be experienced by people working a first night shift. This report makes one recommendation to DB Schenker concerning its management of fatigue, two recommendations to the Office of Rail Regulation concerning guidance on the management of fatigue and the accuracy of mathematical models used to predict fatigue, and one recommendation to RSSB on improving rail industry information on fatigue-related accidents and incidents. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Station overrun incident at Stonegate\n  ", "text": "Shortly after 08:00 hrs on 8 November 2010, a passenger train running from London Charing Cross to Hastings failed to stop at Stonegate station in East Sussex. The train ran for a further 2.45 miles (3.94 km) with the emergency brake applied, passing the level crossing at Crowhurst Bridge before coming to a stop 3.22 miles (5.18 km) after first applying the brakes. No-one was hurt and there was no damage to the train or to the track. The train completed the journey to Hastings after a short delay. Rail adhesion conditions were poor on that day due to high winds causing fresh leaf fall, and the onset of rain. The line had been treated to improve adhesion the previous evening. It is likely that the train failed to stop at Stonegate station because there was almost certainly no sand in the sand hoppers at the leading end. If sand had been present, the train braking system would have deposited sand onto the rail head, improving the available adhesion and allowing the train to stop in a much shorter distance. RAIB has made three recommendations to London & South Eastern Railway Ltd, covering improvements in maintenance processes, restrictions on the use of trains that need servicing, driver awareness of low sand conditions and the responsiveness of the sand replenishment regime.

The tamper driver took evasive action when alerted by the train\u2019s horn, and suffered minor injuries. The investigation found that the tamper driver, who entered the railway in contravention of rules and his training, wrongly assumed that the line he was walking on was closed to normal traffic. The unsafe actions of the driver were found to have been a causal factor. However, the investigation also found that the driver did not have the information he needed to get to his tamper in safety. Industry practices in which it was not uncommon for drivers to walk to trains in work sites without having first received a safety briefing were found to be an underlying cause of this accident.

{"title": "\n    Passenger accident at Brentwood station\n  ", "text": "At 23:42 hrs on 28 January 2011, a passenger alighting from the last coach of a train at Brentwood station fell, head first, between the side of the train and the platform. Another passenger who had alighted from the same train saw her begin to fall and was able to hold on to one of her legs. The driver of the train did not see this happen and the train departed from the station with the passenger still in the gap between the train and the platform. The passenger sustained injuries to her leg and head in the accident. At Brentwood station train drivers are required to undertake a safety check after closing the train\u2019s doors and before moving out of the platform. To do this, the driver needs to look out of his cab window at the first six coaches of the train and look at a platform-mounted monitor to see the last two coaches of the train. The driver of the train involved in the accident had stopped beyond the monitor and in a position where it was only just possible to see the image. He performed the safety check as the train started to move and it is therefore unlikely that he was able to see the events happening at the last coach of the train before the image in the monitor was obscured. It is also possible that his view of the last coach was obstructed by a passenger walking along the platform. The investigation found that the passenger had tried to alight as the doors started to close and then fell as she squeezed between the leaves of the door. The investigation also identified weaknesses in the way that the train operator, National Express East Anglia, had trained, briefed and monitored its drivers who are required to dispatch trains from unstaffed platforms and in the way that it addressed the risk from driver-only operation of trains. There were also weaknesses in the way that key items of equipment (monitors and signage provided to indicate to a train driver where to stop) were configured on the platform where the accident occurred. RAIB has made five recommendations:   Response to recommendations: three to National Express East Anglia relating to driver training and assessment, risk assessment reviews and the availability of CCTV equipment on trains one to Network Rail relating to working with train operators to assess periodically the suitability of equipment provided at unstaffed platforms to assist train drivers to dispatch trains one to the Rail Safety and Standards Board relating to the inclusion within industry guidance of a clause on observing train doors while they are closing by all staff involved in train dispatch, so far as is reasonably practicable.

{"title": "\n    Derailment of a passenger train near Dryclough Junction\n  ", "text": "At 06:07 hrs on 5 February 2011 a derailment occurred close to Dryclough Junction, in Halifax. Both vehicles of a two-car passenger train were derailed when the train ran into stone rubble on the track. The rubble had fallen from a retaining wall beside the line which had collapsed during the night. There were eight passengers and two crew members on the train and nobody was injured in the accident. The collapse of the wall followed a period of heavy rain. The local authority highways department had reported cracks in the pavement behind the wall to Network Rail on several occasions, most recently in October 2010, and had closed the footpath as a precaution. The investigation found deficiencies in the examination of the wall by Network Rail\u2019s examination contractor and in the way in which Network Rail handled reports from Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council concerning problems with the wall. The limited extent of repairs made to the wall in 2006 also contributed to its failure. RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail, relating to the structures examination process, the control of minor civil engineering construction works and the system for dealing with reports from third parties of problems with Network Rail infrastructure.   Response to recommendations:   RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Track worker incidents, Clapham Junction and Earlsfield\n  ", "text": "At around 06:00 hrs on 8 March 2011, two gangs of Network Rail track maintenance staff were involved in incidents with trains between Clapham Junction and Earlsfield stations. The gangs were setting up an emergency speed restriction after the discovery of a rail defect earlier that morning. The work was being carried out following the late handback of an engineering possession. There were no casualties, and only minor disruption to train services following the incidents. The staff involved did not follow the rules for setting up safe and appropriate systems of work. This was due to a combination of factors including excessive workload, the pressure to complete the work, fatigue and / or tiredness, the complexity of the rules, the absence of checking of the arrangements by a third party, the ineffectiveness of Network Rail\u2019s competence management process and a shortage of staff. RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to the arrangements for carrying out unplanned and / or emergency work, the pressure on those responsible for setting up protection arrangements for access to the railway in such situations, the workload of Track Section Managers, the competence of staff in situations which are encountered infrequently and the provision of confirmation to the signaller that an emergency speed restriction has been set up.

{"title": "\n    Partial failure of railway bridge 94, Bromsgrove\n  ", "text": "On 6 April 2011, an assistant track section manager ( ) employed by Network Rail discovered a structure (Bridge 94, on the main line between Birmingham and Gloucester) supporting the track which he believed to be collapsing. He was on site to check a hole in the ballast under sleepers on the down main line, first identified during a routine track inspection eight days previously, which had reappeared despite being filled with clean ballast. The   arranged for track maintenance staff to attend site during the evening to monitor the track. They discovered that ballast was falling into a watercourse under each passing train, and reported the failure to Network Rail\u2019s fault control. Staff on site arranged an emergency speed restriction, followed by the diversion of trains onto other lines to bypass the failing structure. There were no injuries, but severe disruption continued until after emergency repairs were complete 36 hours later. Nobody had inspected the part of the structure where the failure occurred since 2001 because neither Railtrack/Network Rail nor their structures examination contractor recognised the need for staff who were trained and equipped to enter a confined space to examine this structure. Consequently the condition of the part of the structure supporting the track was unknown. RAIB has identified one learning point from this incident: the importance of undertaking reconnaissance visits as an integral part of the planning process for detailed examinations. RAIB has also made recommendations to Network Rail that focus on improving the awareness of structures which are not easily visible from track level, and improving the structures examination regime. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

This crossing is on the main line between Gloucester and Newport. The railway signal protecting the level crossing was showing green, and the train was travelling at 59 mph (94 km/h). The red flashing lights intended to instruct road users to stop were operating and there were no road vehicles on the crossing. No injuries or damage resulted from the incident. The crossing keeper had raised the up side barrier manually during the 90 minutes before the incident, due to a defect in the equipment controlling the barrier motors. Shortly before the incident, the crossing keeper lowered the barriers for a train approaching from the direction of Gloucester. He then raised both barriers manually just before the Cardiff to Nottingham train arrived at the crossing. An annunciator (buzzer) intended to warn the crossing keeper about approaching trains did not give the usual warning. The railway signals protecting Lydney crossing should have been placed at danger before the barriers could be raised safely. The crossing keeper had no facility to control these signals, and did not inform signallers at Newport who could have kept the signals at danger while the barriers were raised. Several possible reasons for not informing the signaller have been identified. RAIB has made recommendations to Network Rail relating to the adequacy of instructions and training given to crossing keepers and signallers; and, the process used for on-going assessment of staff competencies. RAIB has also recommended that Network Rail should modify standards for new and upgraded crossings so that protecting signals always display a stop aspect when the crossing barriers are raised.

{"title": "\n    Detachment of a cardan shaft at Durham station\n  ", "text": "On 10 April 2011, at around 12:30 hrs, a cardan shaft fell from an empty class 142 passenger train travelling through Durham station at 75 mph (120 km/h). The train ran for a distance of approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) before being stopped. A member of the public standing on a platform suffered a minor injury from ballast thrown up as the cardan shaft fell onto the track; the train suffered damage, including loss of diesel fuel. The immediate cause of the detachment was the complete fracture of a final drive input shaft. The input shaft fractured because a seized input bearing generated a large amount of frictional heat between the shaft and bearing. The input shaft was locally heated to a temperature at which its strength was reduced so that it could no longer carry its normal loading. RAIB established that the seizure of the bearing was due to the setup of the bearings during overhaul which resulted in a lack of end float in the bearings when in operation. The final drive failure was not detected by the checks which were in place to identify the onset of such failures. The detached cardan shaft was not retained by its safety loops. RAIB has made six recommendations to Northern Rail and owners of class 14x vehicles. Two recommendations relate to reviewing the end float and alignment requirements for the class 14x final drives and ensuring that any changes to the setup of safety critical components are validated. One recommendation covers the detection of impending final drive failures. The fourth recommendation relates to the final drive post-overhaul testing and the fifth covers the provision of key design information to overhaul and maintenance contractors. The final recommendation relates to the completion of the review work associated with the events in the immediate aftermath of the accident.

{"title": "\n    Collapse of overhead line equipment near Jewellery Quarter tram stop\n  ", "text": "At 13:25 hrs on 20 April 2011, a tram travelling towards the Jewellery Quarter tram stop on the Midland Metro struck an item of overhead line equipment (OLE), known as a cantilever, which had previously become partially detached from its supporting pole. This damaged the tram and led to a progressive collapse of the OLE for about 200 metres, which resulted in further damage to the tram. Three adult and three child passengers suffered injuries which required hospital treatment as a result of the accident. The cantilever became detached because part of the assembly which connected it to its supporting pole, known as the reducing sleeve, had fractured after becoming mechanically overloaded. This overload resulted from a combination of the cantilever becoming momentarily restrained at some point along its length and either the introduction of an abnormal load (following the failure of a tensioned component) or the action of operating loads within the OLE. The cantilever may also have been restrained to some degree from rotating around its supporting pole. This restraint, the way in which the cantilever was installed, the ambient temperature and reduced clearances around tensioned components were also possibly factors in creating the overload. RAIB has made seven recommendations to National Express Midland Metro. These cover; Response to recommendations: the understanding of relevant failure mechanisms within the OLE system and the prevention of further similar incidents the change control of safety critical OLE components the management of the possible risks created by a driver becoming incapacitated during an incident the maintenance of mandatory competences held by members of tram crew.

{"title": "\n    Incident between Dock Junction and Kentish Town\n  ", "text": "At around 18:26 hrs on 26 May 2011, a First Capital Connect service from Brighton to Bedford lost traction power and became stranded between St. Pancras and Kentish Town stations. Almost three hours elapsed before the train, with its passengers still on board, was assisted into Kentish Town station. During the period that the train was stranded, conditions for passengers became increasingly uncomfortable because the train was heavily loaded and the air-conditioning and toilets stopped working at an early stage. Some passengers opened doors to improve ventilation and passenger alarms were repeatedly activated. The strategy for rescuing the stranded train was to bring another train onto the front and haul it into Kentish Town station. The arrival of the assisting train was delayed and it did not couple onto the front of the failed train until around 20:20 hrs. During the next 50 minutes, the driver of the combined train tried to complete the arrangements necessary for its movement into Kentish Town. He was hampered by further operation of alarms by passengers frustrated at the continuing delay, and his uncertainty over the status of the doors (open or closed) on part of the train. A small number of passengers started to alight from the train. Eventually, the driver over-rode a safety system in order to move the train. At the time when the train moved a short distance for the driver to test that it was properly coupled, some passengers were still alighting from the train to the track. When the train subsequently moved into Kentish Town, it did so with at least two doors open. The investigation found that options for evacuating passengers, other than the use of an assisting train, had either been discounted or had not been briefed to those staff responsible for developing the rescue strategy on the day. There had been very little communication with passengers during the incident because the public address system on the train failed about 45 minutes after the train became stranded. Previous incidents of a similar nature had been investigated by First Capital Connect, but actions had not been taken on the findings. RAIB has made:   Response to recommendations:   one recommendation to First Capital Connect in relation to its management processes for emergency preparedness one recommendation to Network Rail and the train operators on developing a set of principles for dealing with stranded trains one recommendation to Network Rail and the train operators to review their processes for undertaking incident reviews so that safety lessons are captured, tracked to closure and shared with other industry stakeholders.

The tram was approaching Piccadilly Gardens, from the direction of Market Street, at a speed of about 9 mph (15 km/h) when a pedestrian ran into its path. The pedestrian appeared to become aware of the tram and tried to stop before reaching the track, but fell directly in front of the tram. Although the tram had started to brake before reaching the pedestrian, it did not come to a complete stand before the pedestrian had come into contact with the under-run protector. This is a device that projects down from the underside of the tram and is designed to prevent pedestrians from being crushed under the wheels. RAIB has made two recommendations to UK tram operators in conjunction with UKTram (a body representing UK tram operators). These relate to improvements in the collection of pedestrian injury data in order to better understand the role of the tram front end design in minimising injury, and to research into the design of tram front ends and their potential for injuring pedestrians in collisions.

There were no road vehicles or pedestrians on the crossing at the time. The immediate cause of the incident was that the train driver did not notice that the indicator close to the crossing was flashing red until it was too late for him to stop the train before it reached the crossing. Factors behind this included the driver\u2019s \u2018workload\u2019 (his need to observe a screen in the cab at the same time as he should also be observing a lineside indicator), the design of the equipment associated with the operation of the level crossing, and the re-setting of the signalling system on board the train before it could depart from Aberystwyth. An underlying cause of the incident was that the signalling system now in use on the lines from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli does not interface with the automatic level crossings on these routes. RAIB has made six recommendations, three directed to Network Rail, two to Arriva Trains Wales and one to the Rail Safety and Standards Board. These cover the development of engineering solutions to mitigate the risk of trains passing over automatic crossings which have not operated correctly; changes to the operating equipment of Llanbadarn crossing; the processes used by railway operators to request permission to deviate from published standards; the operational requirements of drivers as trains depart from Aberystwyth; and the way in which drivers interact with the information screens of the cab signalling used on the Cambrian lines.

The train crew did not take prompt action to deal with the situation and the boiler overheated, damaging the locomotive and giving rise to a risk of injury to the train crew if the overheated metal had ruptured. The cause of the incident was that the driver did not ensure that sufficient water was put into the boiler during the journey and did not remove the fire from the locomotive when he realised the water had run low.

The driver of the maintenance vehicle subsequently reported seeing a similar panel on the trackside, one mile further on. No-one was injured. The panels, approximately 2.5 m high by 1.0 m wide, were from two modified freight containers, which were fitted with power-generation equipment and were being exported overseas. The panels had covered two ventilation apertures in the container sides. They had been fitted as a temporary measure to help prevent water ingress during the sea voyage. The cause of the accident was that screws securing the panels became loose during rail transit. This was initiated by a loss of the clamping force in the bolted joint because of the mechanical properties of a foam seal that was fitted. The manufacturer had ensured that the containers were approved in accordance with the International Convention for Safe Containers (the regulatory regime used for assuring the structural safety of freight containers used internationally and transported by surface means). However, neither the convention nor the manufacturer required a structural assessment of this bolted joint. The operational safeguards used to prevent unsuitable freight containers being carried on the railway relied on visual examination, and were therefore unable to identify the hidden structural defect. RAIB has made three recommendations to the Heath and Safety Executive.

{"title": "\n    Derailment at Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh\n  ", "text": "At about 17:52 hrs on 27 July 2011, an empty passenger train derailed while traversing points in the Princes Street Gardens area, on its approach to Edinburgh Waverley station. The leading bogie of the third coach of the three-coach train derailed and travelled derailed for approximately 110 metres. The derailment occurred at slow speed and the train remained upright. The driver and conductor, the only occupants of the train, were uninjured. The derailment affected two lines which were closed until 29 July 2011. The investigation found that the first wheel to derail was not correctly steered by the moveable switch rail to the correct route. Instead the wheel climbed over the rail, pulling the other wheels of the bogie into derailment. The most likely cause of the derailment was that the angle of the switch rail, possibly aided by an increase in friction, enabled the wheel to climb the switch rail. Three days prior to the accident the left-hand switch rail had been identified as having the potential to cause derailment. Although it was worn beyond repair by grinding in accordance with the company standard, a grinding repair was attempted. The subsequent inspection process did not find the switch to be unsafe and it remained in service. The required prior scoping of the repair, which might have identified the unsuitability of the switch rail for repair by grinding, was not carried out. The local practice of maintaining points to safety limits and the lack of guidance on when a switch rail is unrepairable by grinding were underlying factors in this accident. RAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to: Response to recommendations: the provision of maintenance intervention limits on switches the need for a review of the relevant standard to provide assurance that it addresses all potential derailment mechanisms on switches and to clarify its requirements the development of a more accurate method for gauging the angle of switch rails the increased use of automatic lubrication on switches vulnerable to wear the need to review and address the recurrence of factors in this accident which were previously identified by the RAIB in investigations of similar derailment.

{"title": "\n    AOCL Class investigation\n  ", "text": "Following the fatal accident at Halkirk automatic open level crossing, Caithness, on 29 September 2009, RAIB decided to carry out two separate investigations. The first of these was into the Halkirk accident, while the second was to investigate the more general safety issues associated with automatic open level crossings installed on Network Rail\u2019s managed infrastructure. This report addresses the more general safety issues. RAIB\u2019s investigation confirmed that automatic open level crossings, which are protected only by road traffic light signals, and have no barriers, are the highest risk form of level crossing for vehicle drivers on public roads, and some of them have a significant history of incidents and accidents. The investigation found that the lack of barriers at automatic open level crossings is the most significant factor contributing to vehicle drivers passing the road traffic light signals when they are operating, either deliberately or as a genuine error. RAIB considers that the crossings with the highest risk of collision between trains and road vehicles should be upgraded, probably by fitting half barriers, but there may be other means which deliver an equivalent or better level of safety (eg closure). The high cost of new level crossings is a reason why it can be difficult to justify upgrading existing crossings based on a cost benefit analysis. However, a system is being developed to retro-fit half barriers to existing automatic open crossings at a much lower cost than that of a new crossing. If this initiative is successful, it will be easier to justify the upgrade of existing crossings. RAIB believes that this work should be prioritised accordingly. The safety of level crossings can be improved by taking action against vehicle drivers who deliberately pass the flashing red lights. Where this behaviour is prevalent, red light enforcement equipment is a deterrent. RAIB believes that the development of fixed digital cameras and their installation at selected level crossings, particularly in combination with greater penalties, would be beneficial in improving safety and should be prioritised. The identification of factors at each crossing that lead to deliberate risk taking behaviour or genuine errors would enable appropriate risk reduction measures to be implemented. RAIB believes that the existing risk assessments of automatic open level crossings should be reviewed to check whether all the relevant factors have been identified, and to determine whether additional mitigation measures are required. Finally, RAIB believes that Network Rail\u2019s process covering the risk assessment of level crossings should include guidance to its staff on how to identify the relevant human factors, and take account of the associated risk, at specific level crossings in order to determine the adequacy of existing mitigation measures and the need for additional measures. This builds upon a similar recommendation RAIB made following its investigation of the Halkirk accident. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 15/2013: Dangerous occurrence at Blatchbridge Junction\n  ", "text": "At approximately 19:27 hrs on 19 March 2012, train 6Y33 was approaching Blatchbridge Junction, near Frome in Somerset. The train was made up of a number of engineering vehicles including a track renewal unit (known as a P95 machine). Part of the P95 machine included two control cabs, which were attached to an overhead supporting beam. One of these cabs, weighing around 1.25 tonnes, became detached from the overhead beam and fell to the track below (a distance of around 450 mm). The unsecured control cab remained loosely connected to its vehicle by electrical control cables and an air brake hose. These helped to guide the control cab in a relatively straight line as it slid along the top of the rails beneath the train, until the train stopped around 1 \u00bd miles further on. A foot crossing was damaged as the control cab slid along the rails. The control cab itself was significantly damaged and was rebuilt following the incident. The incident occurred because all eight bolts securing the control cab broke. The bolts broke due to a combination of factors, including: The RAIB has made seven recommendations. Four are addressed to Network Rail (three of which require working with AmeyColas, the operator and maintainer of the P95) and three recommendations are addressed to Matisa (UK) Ltd who represent the vehicle manufacturer. Response to recommendations: When the P95 machine was in its working mode (moving at less than walking pace) the bolts securing the cab experienced very high stress for very short periods. This cycle of strain events occurred several times each shift and caused fatigue in the bolts. \u00a0 The fatigue strength of the bolts was reduced by the presence of corrosion on the bolts. The design of the bolt mounting arrangement allowed moisture to reach the bolts. Some of the bolts had broken before the incident and maintenance of the P95 had not identified this because the maintenance instructions were not clear and lacked technical detail. \u00a0 It is possible that a previous incident adversely affected the fatigue performance of some of the bolts securing the control cab. Other bolts may have been affected by the uneven change in load. \u00a0 Following the previous incident the bolts were not inspected because it was believed damage to the control cab was only superficial and the maintenance instructions did not indicate that the bolts needed to be removed for inspection following an incident directly affecting the control cab.

{"title": "\n    Report 11/2013: Dangerous occurrence at Lindridge Farm user worked crossing\n  ", "text": "At about 07:38 hrs on 22 March 2012, a motorist used the telephone at Lindridge Farm user worked crossing, near Bagworth in Leicestershire, to ask the signaller at Network Rail\u2019s East Midlands Control Centre for authorisation to cross the railway. The signaller checked the indications on his workstation, observed that a train had already passed over the crossing, and gave permission to cross. The motorist opened the near gate, crossed the railway line on foot, and while opening the far gate saw a train approaching. The motorist called the signaller back to report what had happened. The immediate cause of the incident was that the signaller believed the train had already passed the level crossing when he gave the motorist permission to cross because his workstation view showed the level crossing in the wrong place. This error had been present on the workstation view from the time it was commissioned on 3 January 2012 as part of a project to transfer control of the railway from Leicester signal box to the East Midlands Control Centre. This project had redrawn a signalling plan for the Leicester area and introduced an error; a track circuit was incorrectly named. This error was not noticed and was copied into a scheme plan, which was subsequently used to check the design of the signaller\u2019s workstation views. During these design checks, the level crossing was moved to the wrong track section on the view, so that it corresponded with the error on the scheme plan. The error on the view was not identified during testing so the signaller\u2019s workstation was commissioned with the level crossing shown in the wrong place. RAIB also observes: the signaller did not report the incident straight away; the workstation had been commissioned with two other user worked crossings shown in the wrong place; and the other two level crossings had also previously been shown in the wrong place on the signaller\u2019s panel at Leicester signal box prior to the transfer of control to the EMCC. RAIB has made five recommendations, all directed at Network Rail. These cover the management of signalling source records needed for a re-control project, ways of reducing the likelihood of errors on signalling or scheme plans, correlating new signalling displays to the existing display, improving the management of deferred test logs, and better controls for installing telephones at level crossings. RAIB also identified a learning point for the railway industry, about the importance of immediately reporting allegations of incidents that are received from members of the public.

When the train reached 8 km/h, a safety system on the train closed the doors, but not before the train had entered the tunnel with the leading set of saloon doors open. No-one was hurt in the incident. The train, consisting of new 2009 tube stock, is fitted with sensitive edge doors designed to apply the brakes if a thin object trapped by the doors is detected. The sensitive edge system was activated when the train stopped at the previous station, Oxford Circus. The train left Warren Street station with the doors open because the train operator had omitted to close them, having previously disabled the train door interlock (a safety system that requires the doors to be closed before a train can start). The train operator was unable to reset the sensitive edge system between Oxford Circus and Warren Street, and became more and more confused in his attempts to resolve it. RAIB found that the modification to allow train operators to override an activated sensitive edge system had changed the operation of an indication light, which probably misled the train operator. Deficiencies in the train operator\u2019s competence had not been identified and this lack of competence was also a probable factor leading to the train operator\u2019s confusion. RAIB has made four recommendations to London Underground Ltd covering a review of the guidance and instructions to train operators relating to resolving activated sensitive edge systems; the process of managing engineering change; the competence management of train operators; and the requesting of operational and technical support by train operators.

{"title": "\n    Report 09/2013: Collision at Bradford Interchange station\n  ", "text": "At around 06:50 hrs on 25 March 2012, a machine operator was in the process of removing a road-rail dumper from the railway close to Bradford Interchange station. As it was being lowered onto its road wheels, it ran away for 380 metres down a gradient towards the station. The operator, who was on the dumper, was unable to stop it and jumped clear before it collided with the buffer stops in platform 1. The operator received minor injuries, and the dumper and buffer stop sustained some damage. The RAIB\u2019s investigation identified that the dumper was not in a fully braked state when being removed from the track. This was due to a combination of operator error, a wiring irregularity within a control circuit, and the underlying design of the same control circuit which prevented the operator from recovering the situation once the runaway had begun. The RAIB has made five recommendations. Two recommendations have been made to Quattro Plant Limited, the owner and maintainer of the dumper. It was also responsible for the design and installation of the braking control circuit and provided the machine operator. One of these recommendations relates to improving the level of safety assurance when undertaking modifications to road-rail vehicles (RRVs). The other relates to better management of the competence of its staff. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail. One is in relation to minimising the risk of runaways on certain types of RRVs on which the design restricts the ability to regain control of an RRV once it has begun to runaway. Another relates to reviewing and improving compliance monitoring and assurance activities, which both Network Rail and its rail plant suppliers undertake, in order to provide better focus on matters relating to the safe maintenance and operation of RRVs. The third recommendation is to review two aspects of the engineering acceptance process, to give clarity to rail plant suppliers and those assessing modifications to RRVs. The RAIB has also identified a learning point for RRV owners regarding possible improvements to the layout of RRV controls to minimise unintentional operation. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

The RAIB investigation found that, in addition to the passenger\u2019s actions, the following factors led to the incident: As a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations, which cover: Response to recommendations: there was a fault condition on the set of doors involved in the incident which, with the arm trapped, not only disabled the obstruction detection system and prevented the door reopening, but also enabled the driver to release the train brakes and apply traction power the passenger was unable to pull her trapped arm out of the door the driver of the train did not notice the trapped passenger in the few seconds between closing the doors and leaving the station. measures to reduce and monitor the number of deliberate door obstructions improvements to the reliability of the door control circuits improving driver\u2019s visibility of the platform/train interface at stations changing the method used to test door obstacle extraction forces to one that is aligned with the intentions of the relevant Railway Group Standard clarifying Railway Group Standard GM/RT2473, which specifies how to test door obstacle extraction forces.

{"title": "\n    Report 16/2013: Signal passed at danger at Stafford\n  ", "text": "At about 13:35 hrs on 26 April 2012, a locomotive operated by Devon & Cornwall Railways passed signal SD4-81 at Stafford, which was displaying a red aspect, by about 94 metres. The investigation found that the locomotive had been travelling at excessive speed as it approached the Stafford area. The driver was probably aware that he had been exceeding the maximum permitted speed for a locomotive running on its own, but he did not make a full brake application as soon as he saw the signal displaying a double yellow aspect, which was his preliminary warning of the red signal ahead. The driver probably did not have sufficient experience or competence for the task he was performing and Devon & Cornwall Railways had not followed its own process for managing the competence of drivers. The company also had insufficient management controls to ensure compliance with its safety management system. The Office of Rail Regulation had not examined the implementation of Devon & Cornwall Railways\u2019 safety management system following the issue of the company\u2019s safety certificate nearly two years before this incident. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Devon & Cornwall Railways, covering the competence of safety-critical staff and locomotive maintenance. Two recommendations have been addressed to the Office of Rail Regulation, covering its supervision of a new operator\u2019s safety management system and the effectiveness of Devon & Cornwall Railways\u2019 safety management system. One recommendation has been made to RSSB for the relevant rail industry standard to address the assessment of the training needs of train drivers and other staff transferring between employers. A key learning point has been identified relating to the examination and maintenance of vehicles that are used infrequently on the main line. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 01/2013: Fatal accident at Kings Mill No.1 level crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 16:32 hrs on 2 May 2012, a cyclist who was using the footpath and bridleway level crossing at Kings Mill, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, was struck and fatally injured by a passenger train travelling at about 56 miles per hour (90 kilometres per hour). The cyclist rode over the crossing into the path of the train. He was unaware of the train\u2019s approach, probably because he had not looked towards it after passing through the gate protecting the crossing and he was wearing earphones, which probably prevented him from hearing warnings sounded by the train\u2019s horn. The RAIB has made one recommendation, which is not related to the causes of the accident, but arises from matters relating to the management and history of the crossing that were observed during the investigation. Addressed to the Health & Safety Executive and the Office of Rail Regulation, it is intended to improve the awareness of local authorities (who may promote or approve developments which affect the usage of level crossings) in relation to the hazards which exist at level crossings. There is also a key learning point for Network Rail and other crossing operators, relating to the importance of considering all possible measures to reduce risk at crossings, not just those that involve major changes. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 23/2012: Fatal accident at Grosmont\n  ", "text": "At around 12:20 hrs on 21 May 2012, a volunteer train guard was fatally injured after becoming trapped between two coaches at Grosmont station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The coaches had just been uncoupled and the accident occurred when the steam locomotive that was reversing the uncoupled coach away from the stationary coaches changed its direction. The driver applied the brake as soon as he realised this, but there was insufficient distance to stop and avoid trapping the guard who had moved back between the vehicles to complete the work associated with the uncoupling. The locomotive changed direction because its screw reverser was not locked and moved under the weight of the valve gear from reverse to forward gear. It is likely that the guard moved back between the coaches because he had no reason to believe that the locomotive and coach moving away from him would change its direction. RAIB has identified two key learning points relating to the locking of screw reversers and not going between railway vehicles unless they are stationary. It has also made a recommendation to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway relating to the competence management system covering shunting. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 08/2014: Class investigation into landslips\n  ", "text": "In response to six landslips which occurred on Network Rail infrastructure between June 2012 and February 2013, RAIB has undertaken a class investigation into earthwork issues related to land neighbouring the railway and to risk management during adverse weather. The landslips occurred at Loch Treig (near Tulloch) on 28 June 2012, at Falls of Cruachan (on the line to Oban) on 18 July 2012, at Rosyth (near Edinburgh) on 18 July 2012, at St Bees (Cumbria) on 30 August 2012, at Bargoed (South Wales) on 30 January 2013 and at Hatfield Colliery (South Yorkshire) on 11 February 2013. The landslips were caused by factors including heavy rain, absent or ineffective drainage and activities undertaken, or not undertaken, on neighbouring land. In several instances trains were being operated without special precautions when there was a significant risk of encountering a landslip. Many of Network Rail\u2019s earthworks were constructed with steeper slopes (and therefore a greater likelihood of landslips) than would be achieved with modern design procedures. Network Rail\u2019s on-going earthwork improvement programme is unlikely to achieve modern criteria in the foreseeable future. Network Rail\u2019s process for managing the resulting earthwork risk includes consideration of risk arising outside the railway boundary. RAIB has found that, in some circumstances, key information provided by specialist staff examining earthworks is not considered when the slope management strategy is determined during evaluation. There is a lack of clarity about who should be carrying out visual checks for risks which can develop on neighbouring land between examinations which take place at intervals of up to ten years. The mandated process for collecting information about neighbouring land is, in parts, difficult to implement and not usually followed. Recent technological developments could offer means of improving the collection of this information. The location and timing of landslips is difficult to predict but they are almost always triggered by relatively high rainfall. When the landslips described in this report took place, Network Rail\u2019s adverse weather risk management process used forecasts of heavy rainfall to implement special precautions at locations where landslips were considered relatively likely. During the investigation, Network Rail has introduced a new process which also takes account of ground saturation and (in addition to likelihood) the possible consequence of a landslip. The RAIB has made five recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, relating to improving management of earthwork and drainage risk arising from neighbouring land; considering all information provided by examiners when undertaking evaluations; and enhancing the new adverse weather risk management process. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 03/2013: Pedestrian struck by a tram at Sandilands tram stop\n  ", "text": "At approximately 09:44 hrs on Wednesday 16 May 2012, a pedestrian was struck by a tram as she crossed the tramway on a foot crossing on the approach to Sandilands tram stop in Croydon. The impact resulted in the pedestrian falling into the space between the platform and the tram. She remained trapped in that position as the tram continued into the platform and suffered serious injuries. The investigation found that the pedestrian had not looked for an approaching tram before she crossed. However, there was a possible obstruction to the pedestrian\u2019s view of approaching trams as she walked towards the entrance to the tram stop and the configuration of the crossing meant that she approached it with her back to trams running on the nearest track. Risk assessments had been undertaken in relation to safety at Sandilands foot crossing (and other foot crossings on the Croydon tram network) in 2008/9 and 2011. The investigation found that methodology employed in the 2008/9 assessment was not a suitable basis for prioritising the foot crossings for safety improvements. With the agreement of the Office of Rail Regulation, London Tramlink mainly prioritised crossings remote from tram stops for safety improvements from 2009 onwards. The 2011 risk assessment, while intended for the purpose of assessing whether the track at tram stops should be filled in between the rails, also identified that the foot crossing at Sandilands represented the highest risk of the 52 crossings that were considered in the review. London Tramlink did not make any safety improvements to reduce the probability of a pedestrian being struck on the foot crossing at Sandilands in response to the findings. Although London Tramlink had taken some action to help it understand the generality of the risk at foot crossings on its network, and had introduced a speed restriction of 25 km/h for trams passing over foot crossings on the approach to all tram stops, its processes for managing the risk at individual crossings were not effective. The investigation also found that two factors affected the consequences of the accident. Firstly, the tram driver did not apply the hazard brake (which achieves a higher rate of retardation than the brake normally employed for stopping trams) after the tram struck the pedestrian. Secondly, there was enough vertical and horizontal clearance to create a survival space for the pedestrian in the position where she fell after the accident. The RAIB has made five recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to London Tramlink in relation to risk assessment at foot crossings, processes for ensuring pedestrians have clear sight of approaching trams and improving organisational competence in safety decision-making. One recommendation has been made jointly to London Tramlink and Tram Operations Ltd in relation to investigation of accidents and incidents. One recommendation has been made to the Office of Rail Regulation in relation to reissuing guidance on various aspects of the design of tram stops and foot crossings. The RAIB has also identified a learning point for tram operators regarding use of the hazard brake when a tram has struck a pedestrian. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 14/2013: Embankment failure near Knockmore\n  ", "text": "At around 07:06 hrs on 28 June 2012, a passenger train scheduled to operate between Belfast and Portrush, ran onto a section of washed-out embankment near Knockmore on the Antrim branch line. The driver applied the emergency brake when he became aware of the hazard but was unable to stop the train before the leading bogie ran over the unsupported rails at the washout. The train came to a stand with the bogies of the leading vehicle either side of the washout. The train did not derail and was subsequently reversed away. There were no injuries. The RAIB investigation found that the following factors led to the incident: Two underlying factors were identified: As a consequence of the incident, the RAIB has made five recommendations to NIR. The first relates to a review of earthworks and structures with respect to flood risk, including the development of a formalised liaison process with the Rivers Agency for the dissemination of relevant information. The second relates to the development of procedures to maintain safety of the line during and following adverse weather conditions. The other three recommendations relate to safety issues not directly connected with the cause of incident; improving safety critical communications, weed control of the Antrim branch line and improvements to accident investigation procedures. Response to recommendations: heavy rainfall in the area during the previous evening; a system of culverts at and downstream of the washout could not cope with the water flows generated by the rainfall, causing localised flooding; the embankment could not withstand the differential water levels that built up across it; \u00a0 the train was sent onto the Antrim branch line without any additional precautions, despite the heavy rainfall; and the driver was unable to see the washout in time to be able to stop the train before it. there was no engagement between Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and the Rivers Agency regarding the potential for flooding due to heavy rainfall at the incident site; and NIR\u2019s weather preparedness procedure did not include a plan for dealing with flooding or heavy rainfall.

{"title": "\n    Report 08/2013: Derailment of a freight train at Shrewsbury station\n  ", "text": "At around 14:13 hrs on 7 July 2012, the leading bogie of the 16th wagon of a freight train derailed all wheels to the left as it passed over a set of points at the north end of Shrewsbury station whilst travelling at 14 mph (22 km/h). The bogie ran derailed for 65 metres causing significant track damage in the process before the train was brought to a stop. There were no injuries as a result of the derailment but the wagon suffered damage. The immediate cause of the derailment was that the points were unsafe to negotiate because of wear and damage. The degradation of the points since the last detailed inspection had not been prevented by the maintenance regime nor had it been identified by the inspection regime. The inspection regime in place at Shrewsbury at the time of the derailment was inconsistent with the risk-based approach intended by Network Rail\u2019s standard aimed at preventing derailment on points. Shrewsbury maintenance delivery unit misinterpreted the intent of this standard, when it was modified in 2008, and ceased regular detailed inspections of the points (this misinterpretation may not have been limited to the Shrewsbury delivery unit). Instead, the inspection regime at Shrewsbury relied solely on a weekly visual inspection by a patroller and a 13-weekly visual inspection by a supervisor. Neither of these inspections triggered the need for a detailed inspection which could have revealed the degradation and the need for remedial actions. The RAIB has made four recommendations and identified a learning point. The first recommendation is for Network Rail to ensure that the risk-based approach intended by the standard covering the risk of derailment on points is re-briefed to all delivery units including Shrewsbury. The second recommendation is for Network Rail to incorporate the findings from this investigation into its review of the standard covering the risk of derailment on points. This review started following the accident at Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh in July 2011 and the publication of the RAIB report in August 2012. The third recommendation is for Network Rail to consider whether it needs to mandate the removal of grease and residue on points during the visual inspection by supervisors. The fourth recommendation is for Freightliner to ensure that it has arrangements in place to assess the risk of continued operation when it has identified deficiencies in its maintenance operations. The learning point is about the importance of providing training and assessment modules when requiring specific competences in standards covering safety critical activities.

{"title": "\n    Report 07/2013: Dangerous occurrence near Roydon station\n  ", "text": "At approximately 13:43 hrs on 16 July 2012, train 2H33, the 13:04 hrs service from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street was approaching a bridge just north of Roydon station, Essex, at a speed of 62 mph (100 km/h). As it did so, two track workers had to run from the bridge in order to avoid being struck by the train. The last of these track workers got clear of the railway line around two seconds before the train passed them. At the time of the incident, these track workers were working on a line which was open to railway traffic. They were being protected by a system of work which relied on a lookout to provide warning of approaching trains. If established correctly, such a system should allow track workers to reach a position of safety at least 10 seconds before a train arrives. This incident occurred because the group\u2019s lookout was not able to give the track workers on the bridge sufficiently early warning of the approach of train 2H33. This was because the controller of site safety (COSS) responsible for protecting the group from train movements had implemented a system of work which was nappropriate, given the nature of the task and the location in which it was being undertaken. The system of work implemented by the COSS had been issued by a planner, who had selected it as an appropriate system based on his knowledge of the location and his previous experience of working on the track. It is possible that this incident could have been avoided had the planner sought approval for the system from a more senior person before it was issued, as is required by Network Rail\u2019s standards. The inexperience of the COSS and the group in implementing this type of system of work was an underlying factor in the accident. The short time-frame in which the work was planned and the experience of the planner were also possible underlying factors. As a result of the investigation, the RAIB has identified two key learning points. These concern the need to keep the late planning of work to a minimum and for persons undertaking the duties of a COSS to follow the requirements of Network Rail\u2019s standards when issued with a system of work on the same shift that a task is to be undertaken. The RAIB has made two recommendations, both addressed to Network Rail. These relate to improving the way in which available sighting distances are assessed by persons undertaking the duties of a COSS or a planner. The RAIB has also restated a previous recommendation addressed to Network Rail which relates to the manner in which training and assessment can deliver practical competences. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 20/2013: Track worker struck by a train at Bulwell\n  ", "text": "At 09:31 hrs on 6 August 2012, train 2W06, the 09:25 hrs service from Nottingham to Worksop, struck and seriously injured an off-track inspector on the up-down Mansfield line near to Bulwell station, in Nottingham. At the time of the accident, the off-track inspector was undertaking an inspection of lineside vegetation on foot. The off-track inspector was struck by the train because he was standing too close to the track. His awareness of where he was standing had become reduced as he was focused on determining his location. It may also have become reduced because he needed to concentrate on some elements of the inspection. Because the off-track inspector was working on a line open to railway traffic, he had implemented a pre-planned system of work to protect himself from train movements. However, this system of work was unsuitable for the location and task being undertaken. Had the most appropriate type of system of work been planned and implemented, then the accident would have been avoided. The off-track inspector did not realise that the system he was using was unsuitable during the inspection, probably due to the way in which it was implemented. He had also not realised it was unsuitable when the system was issued to him prior to the inspection; this was because the information provided to help him check that it was appropriate did not effectively highlight why it was unsuitable. This system of work was issued to the off-track inspector because the planner who had prepared it was unfamiliar with the location. Information provided to support her decisions about which type of system to use either did not effectively highlight its unsuitability or was found by her to be impracticable to use given her workload. In addition, it had become normal practice within the off-track section to plan and implement the least protective type of system of work for undertaking vegetation inspections. This was, in part, because the section only had a limited range of systems to choose from, but probably also because there was an informal agreement within the section to adopt this practice, which contravened the requirements of Network Rail\u2019s standards. Senior managers were unaware that this had occurred as they were provided with inaccurate safety monitoring data. The increased workload of planners within off-track sections was also identified as a factor in the accident. The RAIB has identified two key learning points. These are: that the relevant Network Rail standard should be observed during the planning, approval and verification of systems of work; and that any incident where a train has struck something whilst passing persons working on or near the line should be initially treated as an accident. The RAIB has also made five recommendations addressed to Network Rail. These relate to: the provision of information to staff about which systems of work have been found to be appropriate for given locations; the monitoring of which system of work types are being used; the resources available within off-track sections to plan and approve systems of work; how previous measures taken by Network Rail to improve the management of systems of work were implemented; and the provision of information to staff regarding the required warning times when working alone. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 12/2013: Collision near Arley, Warwickshire\n  ", "text": "At around 04:21 hrs on 10 August 2012, an engineering machine used for maintaining track, known as a stoneblower, collided with a stationary engineering machine, at approximately 22 mph (35 km/h), near Arley, in Warwickshire. A member of staff on the stoneblower was treated in hospital for a minor injury. The stoneblower was badly damaged and deemed to be beyond economic repair. The investigation found that when the stoneblower driver sighted the stationary machine he was driving too fast to avoid a collision. The driver\u2019s speed was probably influenced by a number of factors which led him to expect that the line was clear. It is also possible that the driver was distracted immediately prior to the collision which caused him to be driving faster than he realised. If planned arrangements for the engineering work had been followed the collision would not have occurred. An underlying cause of this accident is the tendency of long worksites, in the absence of controls to keep engineering trains (including machines) apart, to increase the risk of collision. Although not a factor in this accident, it is observed that, for driving at night, the 40 mph (64 km/h) maximum speed of travel permitted in engineering worksites is incompatible with the braking and headlight capabilities of the type of engineering machine involved in the collision. The report observes a number of non-compliances with railway industry rules and company procedures during the management of the engineering work. There is also an observation on the difficulties of maintaining the necessary discipline in the driving cab, where mobile telephones are used for communications, to avoid distracting the driver. The RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. As part of its planned review of the management of engineering work, Network Rail should undertake a fundamental review of the fitness for purpose of the current arrangements and is pointed to a number of areas for potential inclusion in the review. Actions arising from the review should then be implemented. Measures to ensure that train drivers are given all the information they need to make movements safely and to address issues on the use of ntermediaries when conveying information to drivers, are also recommended. In addition, Network Rail is recommended to address a recurrence of specific behavioural issues at its Saltley depot, which the RAIB noted in a previous investigation.

{"title": "\n    Report 24/2014: Rail breaks on the East Coast Main Line\n  ", "text": "This class investigation considers the occurrence and management of rail breaks on Network Rail\u2019s East Coast Main Line (ECML). It includes consideration of rail breaks which occurred at three locations during 2012 and 2013 and which, together with reports that the occurrence of rail breaks on the ECML was relatively high, triggered the investigation. None of these three rail breaks resulted in injuries or damage to trains. A rail break at Corby Glen, near Grantham was triggered by wear of the pad intended to separate the rail from the underlying concrete sleeper. Breaks at Copmanthorpe, near York, and at Hambleton, about 15 miles (24 km) south of York, were due to movement at rail joints caused by inadequate support from the underlying ground. Rail break statistics show that, after allowing for differences in route length and the amount of traffic, the ECML has more rail breaks than comparable main lines. After considering both the types of rail break occurring on the ECML and the measures being taken by Network Rail to manage these, the investigation concluded that the most significant factor in the relatively high number of rail breaks on the ECML between 2009 and 2013 was the relatively high proportion of older track. Network Rail has recognised the relatively high level of rail breaks on the ECML and is replacing older track components on this line. It has also altered the maintenance criteria on the ECML to increase the likelihood of replacing moving (dipped) joints before they cause rail breaks. These measures appear to be reflected in a recent reduction in the occurrence of rail breaks. RAIB has made four recommendations relating to rail breaks and addressed to Network Rail. The first seeks research to improve detection of the very small precursor cracks which usually occur in rails a significant period before the rail breaks. The second relates to the wider adoption of lessons learnt from managing rail breaks on the ECML while the third seeks a routine process for identifying and replacing defective rail pads. The fourth recommendation seeks implementation of improved techniques for detecting precursor cracks if trials using equipment recently fitted to Network Rail\u2019s test trains (ultrasonic testing units) prove successful. A fifth recommendation, also addressed to Network Rail, arises from an observation not directly related to rail breaks and deals with improved highlighting of updated information in safety critical documents. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

A possession is an arrangement whereby the line is closed to normal traffic to allow engineering staff to carry out work. Several items of maintenance work were planned to be carried out in this possession and these items were grouped into four work sites. At 07:04 hrs the person in charge of the possession authorised the reopening of the line to normal traffic when only three of the work sites had completed their work and were clear of the line. Work in the fourth work site was still ongoing when the line reopened to traffic. Seven members of staff were working on the line along with a road-rail excavator and trailer. This work continued for an hour after the line was reopened. No collision occurred as there were no trains scheduled at the time, but there were no measures in place to prevent a train from being signalled through the work site. The person in charge of the possession did not record details of the work site on the possession form. He was under some stress from events outside of his work at the time and this may have affected his performance. Other probable factors were late alterations to the work sites within the possession and the way in which the briefing pack for the possession was presented. The RAIB has identified three learning points related to the use of the possession arrangements form, the way in which possession information packs are prepared and dealing with staff under stress."},

The train began to move a few seconds after she fell; she came into contact with the wheels and suffered life-changing injuries. The train stopped after moving about 43 metres. The train was dispatched by a member of staff on the platform, who operated an indicator which told the train driver when it was safe to start. The person approached the train after this indicator had been operated, and the dispatcher had no means of alerting the train driver to what had happened. The train was stopped by a passenger on board who operated the emergency communication handle. The person who was injured fell into the gap between the platform and the train bodyside, at a point between sets of train doors. The RAIB has identified one learning point for the railway industry arising from this investigation, covering the particular hazards that should be addressed in the industry\u2019s response to the RAIB\u2019s previous recommendation concerning the train dispatch process, made following the investigation into a fatal accident at James Street, Liverpool, in October 2011."},

The young person moved into the path of the tram as it approached the crossing and appeared to be unaware of the tram\u2019s approach. The RAIB has been unable to positively establish why she seemingly did not see and react to the approaching tram or respond to the horn. Apart from a break of 0.3 seconds, this was sounded continuously as she walked towards and onto the tram track. Closed-circuit television coverage from the front of the tram indicates that she did not look towards the tram after she entered the crossing through a chicane on its west side. However, there is no clear evidence to indicate what actions she took at the chicane; it is possible that she may not have looked towards the approaching tram, or looked but not seen it. Furthermore, although there is no direct evidence, it can not be ruled out that she saw the tram approaching and thought that she had enough time to cross, or that it would stop or slow down. Bayles and Wylies crossing consisted of two separately managed crossings of the Nottingham tramway and a parallel Network Rail route. Network Rail closed the crossing in February 2013 pending the construction of a footbridge to replace it. This obviated the need for the RAIB to make any recommendations to improve the crossing. The RAIB has made four recommendations. These cover the manner in which persons in the path of a tram are audibly warned; the marking of the boundary of pedestrian crossings of tramways; the prompts to pedestrians to look for approaching trams; and the best means to illuminate pedestrian crossings to avoid glare that could affect the ability of pedestrians to detect approaching trams. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2013: Collision at Beech Hill level crossing\n  ", "text": "At 12:31 hrs on 4 December 2012 a collision occurred between a passenger train and a car at Beech Hill automatic half barrier (AHB) level crossing near Finningley, on the line between Gainsborough and Doncaster. One of the occupants of the car, a young child, was seriously injured in the collision and later died in hospital. The train involved was operated by East Midlands Trains. It consisted of a single carriage unit and was travelling at 60 mph (96 km/h) at the time of the collision. None of the 20 passengers and two crew members on the train was injured in the accident. Equipment beneath the train was damaged in the collision leading to the spillage of diesel fuel from the train\u2019s fuel tank, but there was no fire. The level crossing was owned and maintained by Network Rail and was fitted with a data logger which showed that the crossing was operating normally at the time of the accident, with the barriers down as the car approached. The car driver stated that she did not see that the road traffic light signals (known as wig-wags) were flashing as she approached and only noticed the lights and barriers when she was very close to the crossing. The weather was sunny at the time of the collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun. The RAIB took the wig-wag units and arranged for testing in an optical laboratory. It was found that they were fitted with 36 W lamps and an obsolete design of red lens unit. Their light output was measured to be well below the specification for lights of this type. Network Rail had no plans in place to replace the light units with brighter ones and had no process to identify that such replacement was necessary. The RAIB has made four recommendations as follows: Response to recommendations: infrastructure managers to determine which level crossings are fitted with 36 W lamps and draw up plans for their replacement with LED units infrastructure managers to devise a method of assessing the risk of a bright background and glare preventing wig-wag signals from being seen and propose means of mitigating this infrastructure managers to introduce a new \u2018brighter\u2019 type of LED wig-wag for use at sites where sunlight glare has been identified as a problem infrastructure managers to enhance the inspection and maintenance process for wig-wag lamps.

{"title": "\n    Report 21/2013: Fatal accident at Saxilby\n  ", "text": "At 13:50 hrs on 4 December 2012, a train travelling from Scunthorpe to Lincoln struck and fatally injured a track worker at Saxilby, near Lincoln. The individual concerned was acting in the role of Controller of Site Safety (COSS) at the time of the accident. He was involved in work taking place on one of the two tracks at this location which was closed to rail traffic, but standing close to the adjacent line over which trains were still operating. The RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the COSS stepped back into the path of the train as it passed the site of work. The following factors led to the accident: The RAIB has also observed that the processes employed by the railway industry during its own investigation into the accident at Saxilby may have taken insufficient account of the trauma that some of the witnesses were suffering as a result of their proximity to the accident. The RAIB has made four recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail regarding the use of agency staff in safety leadership roles, measures to address the risk arising from the use of agency staff in any role that involves working on and around the track and its processes for interviewing witnesses after serious incidents and accidents. One recommendation has been made to Carillion in conjunction with SkyBlue in respect of reviewing the effectiveness of changes made to safety management arrangements following the accident at Saxilby. Response to recommendations: the COSS had not implemented a safe system of work for the task that was being\u00a0undertaken at the time that the accident occurred none of the other track workers on site challenged the absence of a safe system of work or the actions of the COSS who was working within an unsafe area the COSS became distracted and did not see or hear the approaching train no effective action had been taken in response to the involvement of the COSS in two other safety incidents in the two months preceding the accident the COSS had not been subject to an effective formal performance review by the agency (SkyBlue) that had hired him for COSS duties for the work taking place on 4 December 2012 and on other occasions\u00a0 deficiencies and omissions within SkyBlue\u2019s management systems had not been identified by its parent company (Carillion).

{"title": "\n    Report 22/2013: Derailment at Barrow upon Soar\n  ", "text": "At about 04:50 hrs on 27 December 2012, a freight train derailed about 1 mile (1.6 km)north of Barrow upon Soar station, Leicestershire. One of the rails of the line on which the train was travelling, dipped due to the failure of the supporting embankment. The locomotive and first ten wagons remained on the track, the eleventh and twelfth wagons derailed, the thirteenth remained on the track and the rear seven, which separated from the rest of the train, derailed and tipped over. No one was hurt but the track, the embankment and some of the wagons were damaged. The investigation found the embankment failed under the weight of the passing train because water within the embankment had reduced its stability and none of Network Rail\u2019s processes had identified this. It is possible that an evaluation of the embankment could have identified the reduced stability, but the circumstances for triggering an evaluation were unclear, and there was no defined process for reporting trigger events. The investigation also observed that the evaluation process did not make use of rainfall data, or data that showed how the geometry of the track on top of the embankment was changing over time. An additional inspection during flooding could possibly have identified the embankment\u2019s reduced stability. However, none was required at this location as Network Rail did not consider how the embankment was constructed when assessing the risk of an earthwork failure due to water. It is also possible that the embankment\u2019s reduced stability could have been identified by a routine examination, but none was due. A basic visual track inspection had been planned for three days before the accident but it was not completed. It is possible that this planned inspection would have found a track defect which could have led to the discovery of the embankment\u2019s reduced stability. The report makes three recommendations, all to Network Rail, which cover: Response to recommendations: the provision of information to trigger an earthwork evaluation using track geometry and rainfall data to improve the earthwork evaluation process improving the process used to decide if an earthwork should be inspected when a flood warning is issued. \u00a0 RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 18/2013: Train fire at South Gosforth\n  ", "text": "Shortly after 14:00 hrs on 8 January 2013, a train travelling from South Shields to St James on the Tyne and Wear Metro system experienced an electrical fault soon after it left South Gosforth station. A fire developed under the rear car of the two-car train as it came to a stand, and smoke entered the passenger accommodation. There were 45 passengers in the rear car, and they used the emergency handles to release the doors, and evacuated themselves onto the side of the line, with assistance from the driver of the train. No-one was hurt, but there was damage to the electrical equipment and wiring of the rear car, and the overhead electrical supply line parted during the fire. The accident occurred on an above-ground section of line; if it had taken place in a tunnel, the amount of smoke that was produced during the fire might have resulted in serious consequences. The fire was caused by a fault within the line breaker case of the rear car, and was sustained because the protection system associated with the electric power supply to the train did not operate until 45 seconds after the fault started. RAIB has made one recommendation addressed to the infrastructure manager and two addressed jointly to the infrastructure manager and train operator of the Tyne and Wear Metro, covering the fault in the line breaker, the radio system in use on the network, and the maintenance of the emergency door release handles on the Metro cars. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 02/2014: Derailment at Castle Donington\n  ", "text": "At about 19:55 hrs on 21 January 2013, a freight train consisting of 26 empty wagons, hauled by a diesel locomotive, derailed at Castle Donington, Leicestershire. The eighteenth wagon derailed first, followed by the nineteenth and twentieth wagons. Subsequently, the train divided between the nineteenth and twentieth wagons, causing the brake to apply. There was extensive track damage, but no-one was hurt. The immediate cause was that cyclic top before the point of derailment excited the suspension of the eighteenth wagon causing the left-hand leading wheel to become unloaded and to derail to the left. There had been a recurrence of cyclic top faults in the vicinity of where the derailment occurred, and the routine inspection and maintenance had not kept the track in an acceptable condition. In particular, planned stoneblowing on 20 November 2012, which should have included the track through the point of derailment, stopped before reaching it due to shortage of time. An underlying factor was that the ballast supporting the track was fouled, causing the track to be inadequately supported and leading to the recurrent cyclic top. The need to renew the ballast had been identified, but the work was not programmed to be carried out until 2016/17. This was in line with Network Rail\u2019s policy for renewals on the route. The RAIB has made two recommendations, one directed to Network Rail and one to RSSB. The recommendation to Network Rail covers reviewing, and if necessary, improving the planning of stoneblowing so that there is sufficient time to complete the work. The recommendation to RSSB (in conjunction with the rail industry) is to review the current Rule Book requirements relating to the action required following an abnormal brake application, and to make any changes found necessary to reduce the risk of trains colliding with a derailed rail vehicle. The RAIB has also identified three learning points about: Response to recommendations: checking track, following the passage of trains, after lifting and packing work using appropriately qualified staff to raise speed restrictions following work to remedy poor track condition staff communicating safety information so that it is clearly and accurately understood. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 07/2014: Derailment at Ordsall Lane Junction\n  ", "text": "At 14:34 hrs on 23 January 2013 a class 47 diesel electric locomotive derailed on a small radius curve, approaching Ordsall Lane Junction in Salford, and caught fire. The locomotive derailed to the outside of the curve. It was being hauled on the rear of an empty train, which was formed of another class 47 locomotive and five coaches. The cause of the derailment was that the lateral forces acting at the wheel-rail interface, as the locomotive negotiated the curve, were sufficient to cause the leading right-hand wheel to climb the rail. Despite being required by standards, there was no check rail on the curve. This safeguard would have restricted the lateral displacement of the wheels and prevented the derailment. The RAIB found that the following factors had resulted in the lateral forces being high enough to initiate wheel climbing conditions: The above combined to generate the conditions necessary for derailment, but none of these factors involved non-compliance with applicable standards. Although it was found that the reprofiling of the wheels had left the wheel surface slightly rougher than specified, the RAIB decided not to investigate this factor any further. This was because the surface was only marginally non-compliant and there is contradictory evidence regarding its effect on wheel-rail friction. The basic approach to managing the risk of derailment on small radius curves on the national network relies on vehicles and track complying with separate technical standards. However, because these standards do not require consideration of the worst possible combination of conditions, there remains a residual risk of derailment. It is generally recognised by the railway industry that the level of this residual risk is reduced by certain traditional features, such as check rails and trackside rail lubricators. Therefore, although not generally relied upon, RAIB observed that any change in the provision of such features has the potential to reduce the overall level of derailment safety. Response to recommendations: The dry and clean state of the inside face of the outer rail on the curve that enabled high levels of wheel-rail contact friction to be established; recently-modified arrangements for lubricating the rails did not prevent this Machining work that had recently been undertaken to restore the wheel profiles on the locomotive; this removed any pre-existing lubricant and contaminant from the locomotive wheels that would otherwise have helped reduce wheel-rail contact friction levels The relatively low angle of contact between the wheel and rail associated with the newly-restored wheels on the locomotive; this reduced the locomotive\u2019s ability to resist the climbing forces acting at the wheel-rail interface The wider than normal distance between the rails (track gauge) that had developed on the curve.

{"title": "\n    Report 01/2014: Fatal accident at Motts Lane level crossing\n  ", "text": "At 17:37 hrs on 24 January 2013, a cyclist who was using the footpath and bridleway level crossing at Motts Lane, near Witham in Essex, was struck and fatally injured by a passenger train travelling at almost 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour). It was dark at the time. The red/green lights provided at the crossing to indicate the approach of trains were showing red, and the associated audible warning was sounding. The cyclist was unaware that the train was so close to the crossing, probably because it was difficult to pick out the train\u2019s headlight amongst the lights of Witham station, about 700 metres from the crossing. The cyclist rode onto the crossing into the path of the train, although the lights were showing red. Although it is not possible to know why he did this, it may have been because he was used to seeing the lights at red for long periods before trains arrived at the crossing, and decided for himself whether it was safe to cross. The lights showed red for long periods because there were deficiencies in the design of the railway signalling system in the area, and it was not being used as it was designed to be. The RAIB has made four recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, which cover: Response to recommendations: the review and reduction of long waiting times at automatic level crossings the design and checking of software which is used for automatic route setting in signalling control centres minimising the effect of local variations in the way trains are signalled that may affect the length of the periods during which red lights are displayed at level crossings modification of risk management processes for crossings with miniature stop lights to include allowance for the length of time that the red lights show.

{"title": "\n    Report 03/2014: Penetration of a tunnel at Old Street \n  ", "text": "During the morning of 8 March 2013, a train driver reported that flood water was flowing from the roof of a railway tunnel north of Old Street station near central London. The driver of an out-of-service passenger train was asked to examine the tunnel at low speed and check for damage. The driver stopped short of the water flow and reported that two large drills (augers) had come through the tunnel wall and were fouling the line ahead of his train. The augers were being used for boring piles from a construction site about 13 metres above the top of the tunnel. The operators of the piling rig involved were unaware that they were working above an operational railway tunnel. Its position was not shown on the site plan, or on any map available to either the developer or the local planning authority. As a consequence, Network Rail was not consulted during the planning application stage and was unaware of the construction activity. The RAIB has determined that approximately half of the piles required for the new development would have intersected with the tunnel had they had been constructed. It has identified two learning points from this incident which are relevant to the construction industry: clients and design teams should be aware of the importance of information shown on land ownership records; and those carrying out investigations for proposed developments should be aware that not all railway tunnels are shown on Ordnance Survey mapping. The RAIB has also made five recommendations: three are addressed to railway infrastructure managers, and relate to: the provision of information to organisations undertaking property-related searches; the provision of information on the location of railway tunnels and associated subterranean structures; and the identification of development work by third parties. One recommendation is made to the British Standards Institution relating to the enhancement of a British Standard, and one recommendation is addressed to the Department for Communities and Local Government relating to a recommendation made by the RAIB in 2007 which has not been implemented.

{"title": "\n    Report 04/014: Fatal accident at Athelney level crossing\n  ", "text": "At about 06:23 hrs on 21 March 2013, a car drove around the barriers of Athelney automatic half barrier crossing, near Taunton in Somerset. This took the car into the path of a train which was approaching the crossing at high speed. The driver of the car was killed in the resulting collision. The motorist drove around the barriers without waiting for a train to pass and the barriers to re-open. The level crossing was closed to road traffic for longer than normal before the arrival of the train, because of earlier engineering work that had affected the automatic operation of the crossing. The motorist may have believed that the crossing had failed with the barriers in the closed position, or that the approaching train had been delayed. He did not contact the signaller by telephone before he drove around the barriers. The RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to reducing the risk resulting from extended operating times of automatic level crossings and to modifying the location of the pedestrian stop lines at Athelney level crossing. A further recommendation is addressed to Network Rail in conjunction with RSSB, to consider means of improving the presentation of telephones at automatic level crossings for non-emergency use. One recommendation is addressed to the Office of Rail Regulation, to incorporate any resulting improvements which are reasonably practicable into the guidance it publishes on level crossings.

{"title": "\n    Report 05/2014: Tram running with doors open on London Tramlink\n  ", "text": "On 13 April 2013 between 17:33 and 17:38 hrs, a tram travelling from West Croydon to Beckenham Junction, on the London Tramlink system, departed from Lebanon Road and Sandilands tram stops with all of its doors open on the left-hand side. Some of the doors closed automatically during the journey, but one set of doors remained open throughout the incident. The incident ended when a controller monitoring the tram on CCTV noticed that it had departed from Sandilands with its doors open, and arranged for the tram to be stopped. Although there were no casualties, there was potential for serious injury. The tram was able to move with its doors open because a fault override switch, which disables safety systems such as the door-traction interlock, had been inadvertently operated by the driver while trying to resolve a fault with the tram. The driver did not close and check the doors before departing from Lebanon Road and Sandilands partly because he was distracted from dealing with the fault, and partly because he did not believe that the tram could be moved with any of its doors open. The design of controls and displays in the driving cab contributed to the driver\u2019s inadvertent operation of the fault override switch. Furthermore, breakdowns in communication between the driver and the passengers, and between the driver and the controller, meant that neither the driver nor the controller were aware of the problem until after the tram left Sandilands. The RAIB has made eight recommendations. Four of these are to Tram Operations Ltd, aimed at improving the design of tram controls and displays, as well as training of staff on, and processes for, fault handling and communications. Two recommendations have been made to London Tramlink, one (in consultation with Tram Operations Ltd) relating to improving cab displays and labelling and one on enhancing the quality of the radio system on the network. One recommendation is made to all UK tram operators concerning the accidental operation of safety override switches. The remaining recommendation is to the Office of Rail Regulation regarding the provision of guidance on ergonomics principles for cab interface design.

{"title": "\n    Report 15/2014: Runaway of a road rail vehicle and collision in Queen Street High Level Tunnel\n  ", "text": "At about 03:00 hrs on 21 April 2013, a road rail vehicle (RRV) ran away as it was being on-tracked north of Glasgow Queen Street High Level Tunnel on a section of railway sloping towards the tunnel. The RRV ran through the tunnel and struck two scaffolds that were being used for maintenance work on the tunnel walls. A person working on one of the scaffolds was thrown to the ground and suffered severe injuries to his shoulder. The track levelled out as the RRV ran into Glasgow Queen Street station and, after travelling a total distance of about 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometres), it stopped in platform 5, about 20 metres short of the buffer stop. The RRV was a mobile elevating work platform that was manufactured for use on road wheels and then converted by Rexquote Ltd to permit use on the railway. The RRV\u2019s road wheels were intended to provide braking in both road and rail modes. This was achieved in rail mode by holding the road wheels against a hub extending from the rail wheels. The design of the RRV meant that during a transition phase in the on-tracking procedure, the road wheel brakes were ineffective because the RRV was supported on the rail wheels but the road wheels were not yet touching the hubs. Although instructed to follow a procedure which prevented this occurring simultaneously at both ends of the RRV, the machine operator unintentionally put the RRV into this condition. He was (correctly) standing beside the RRV when it started to move, and the control equipment was pulled from his hand before he could stop the vehicle. The RRV was fitted with holding brakes acting directly on both rail wheels at one end of the vehicle. These were intended to prevent a runaway if non-compliance with the operating instructions meant that all road wheel brakes were ineffective. The holding brake was insufficient to prevent the runaway due to shortcomings in Rexquote\u2019s design, factory testing and specification of maintenance activities. The lack of an effective quality assurance system at Rexquote was an underlying factor. The design of the holding brake was not reviewed when the RRV was subject to the rail industry vehicle approval process because provision of such a brake was not required by Railway Industry Standards. RAIB has identified one learning point which reminds the rail industry that the rail vehicle approval process does not cover all aspects of rail vehicle performance. RAIB has made four recommendations. One requires Rexquote to implement an effective quality assurance system and another, supporting an activity already proposed by Network Rail, seeks to widen the scope of safety-related audits applied by Network Rail to organisations supplying rail plant for use on its infrastructure. A third recommendation seeks improvements to the testing process for parking brakes provided on RRVs. The final recommendation, based on an observation, relates to the provision of lighting on RRVs. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 10/2014: Accident at Balnamore level crossing\n  ", "text": "At approximately 03:10 hrs on 31 May 2013, a car driver was forced to take action in order to avoid colliding with an engineering train that was traversing Balnamore automatic half barrier level crossing, which is located between Coleraine and Ballymoney stations on Northern Ireland Railways\u2019 Belfast to Londonderry/Derry line. The car subsequently struck metal fencing forming part of the crossing, causing minor injuries to its two occupants and damage to the car. The crew of the engineering train spoke with the car driver and then continued work without reporting the accident. At the time of the accident, the engineering train was undertaking weed-spraying operations within a possession of the line, which meant that operation of passenger trains on the line had been suspended. Because the line was under possession, Balnamore level crossing, which is normally automatically operated by approaching trains, was being operated manually via its local controls. However, as the train passed over the crossing, its half barriers had not been lowered and its road traffic signals were not operating, even though this was required by the railway rules relating to this type of level crossing. This meant that the car driver did not have enough warning to stop his car before the level crossing became occupied by the train. The RAIB has found that the team responsible for undertaking weed-spraying was routinely not complying with the rules relating to the operation of automatic half barrier level crossings within possessions. This was probably due to a combination of factors, including the team possibly having a low perception of the risks presented by this non-compliance and a desire by them to complete the weed-spraying more quickly. In addition, the team may have been influenced by the status of rules relating to the local control of other types of crossing in possessions and the method of work adopted at level crossings during a recent project. The RAIB has also found that this non-compliance was not detected or corrected by safety checks conducted by Northern Ireland Railways. In addition, the investigation identified that the appointment of additional competent staff to operate crossings within the possession may have prevented the accident from occurring. The RAIB has identified three key learning points. These are: that the person in charge of a possession should correctly complete the form intended to help them keep track of level crossings; that boarding moving trains, where it is prohibited, should be avoided; and that accidents should be reported. The RAIB has also made three recommendations addressed to Northern Ireland Railways. These relate to: ensuring that activities undertaken at level crossings within possessions are subject to effective risk controls; ensuring that method statements relating to track engineering are supported by risk assessments; and increasing the opportunities for non-compliances to be detected and corrected. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 19/2014: Passenger incident Newcastle Central station\n  ", "text": "At 17:02 hrs on 5 June 2013, a passenger was dragged by a train departing from platform 10 at Newcastle Central station. Her wrist was trapped by an external door of the train and she was forced to move beside it to avoid being pulled off her feet. The train reached a maximum speed of around 5 mph (8 km/h) and travelled around 20 metres before coming to a stop. The train\u2019s brakes were applied either by automatic application following a passenger operating the emergency door release handle, or by the driver responding to an emergency signal from the conductor. The conductor, who was in the rear cab, reported that he responded to someone on the platform shouting at him to stop the train. The passenger suffered severe bruising to her wrist. This accident occurred because the conductor did not carry out a safety check before signalling to the driver that the train could depart. Platform 10 at Newcastle Central is a curved platform and safe dispatch is particularly reliant upon following the correct dispatch procedure including undertaking the pre-dispatch safety checks. The investigation found that although the doors complied with the applicable train door standard, they were, in certain circumstances, able to trap a wrist and lock without the door obstruction sensing system detecting it. Once the doors were detected as locked, the train was able to move. In 2004, although the parties involved in the train\u2019s design and its approval for service were aware of this hazard, the risk associated with it was not formally documented or assessed. The train operator undertook a risk assessment in 2010 following reports of passengers becoming trapped. Although they rated the risk as tolerable, the hazard was not recorded in such a way that it could be monitored and reassessed, either on their own fleet or by operators of similar trains. As a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made six recommendations. One of these is for operators of trains with this door design to assess the risk of injuries and fatalities due to trapping and dragging incidents and take the appropriate action to mitigate the risk. Two recommendations have been made to the train\u2019s manufacturer. One of these is to reduce the risk of trapping on future door designs, and the other to review its design processes with respect to hazard identification and recording. One recommendation has been made to the operator of the train involved in this particular accident. This is related to the management of hazards associated with the design of its trains and assessment of the risks of its train dispatch operations. Two recommendations have been made to RSSB. One is to add guidance to the standard on passenger train doors to raise awareness that it may be possible to overcome door obstruction detection even though doors satisfy the tests specified within the standard. The other recommendation is the consideration of additional data which should be recorded within its national safety management information system to provide more complete data relating to the risk of trapping and dragging incidents.

{"title": "\n    Report 11/2014: Near-miss at Llandovery level crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 05:56 hrs on 6 June 2013, train 2M43, the 04:34 hrs passenger service from Swansea to Shrewsbury, was driven over Llandovery level crossing in the town of Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, Wales, while the crossing was open to road traffic. As the train approached the level crossing, a van drove over immediately in front of it. A witness working in a garage next to the level crossing saw what had happened and reported the incident to the police. The level crossing is operated by the train\u2019s conductor using a control panel located on the station platform. The level crossing was still open to road traffic because the conductor of train 2M43 had not operated the level crossing controls. The conductor did not operate the level crossing because he may have had a lapse in concentration, and may have become distracted by other events at Llandovery station. The train driver did not notice that the level crossing had not been operated because he may have been distracted by events before and during the train\u2019s stop at Llandovery, and the positioning of equipment provided at Llandovery station relating to the operation of trains over the level crossing was sub-optimal. RAIB identified that an opportunity to integrate the operation of Llandovery level crossing into the signalling arrangements (which would have prevented this incident)was missed when signalling works were planned and commissioned at Llandovery between 2007 and 2010. The RAIB also identified that there was no formalised method of work for train operations at Llandovery. RAIB has made six recommendations. Four are to the train operator, Arriva Trains Wales, and focus on improving the position of platform equipment, identifying locations where traincrew carry out operational tasks and issuing methods of work for those locations, improvements to its operational risk management arrangements and improving the guidance given to its duty control managers on handling serious operational irregularities such as the one that occurred at Llandovery. Two recommendations are made to Network Rail. These relate to improvements to its processes for signalling projects, to require the wider consideration of reasonable opportunities to make improvements when defining the scope of these projects, and consideration of the practicability of providing a clear indication to train crew when Llandovery level crossing, and other crossings of a similar design, are still open to road traffic.

{"title": "\n    Report 12/2014: Near-miss at Butterswood level crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 07:35 hrs on 25 June 2013 a passenger train was involved in a near-miss with a car on a level crossing near Butterswood in North Lincolnshire. The train passed over the level crossing with the barriers in the raised position and the road traffic signals extinguished. No injuries or damage were caused as a result of the incident. Normally, the approach of the train would have automatically initiated the closure of the crossing. However, the crossing was not working normally because the power supply to the crossing equipment had been interrupted. The crossing was of a type where train drivers are required to check that it is not obstructed as they approach and that it has operated correctly. A flashing light is provided for this purpose, just before the crossing, with a flashing white light displayed if the crossing has correctly closed against road users, and a flashing red light displayed at all other times (including those occasions when the crossing has failed to close on the approach of a train). The driver of the train involved in the near-miss did not notice until it was too late to stop that the flashing light was indicating that the crossing was not working normally, and was still open for road traffic. RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the train driver had the expectation that the crossing would operate normally as the train approached and that he had not focused his attention on the flashing light at the point where he needed to confirm that the crossing had operated correctly for the passage of his train. Although the level crossing had probably failed around nine hours before the incident, the fact of its failure was not known to any railway staff. The investigation also found that the crossing was not protected with automatic warning system equipment and that the maintenance arrangements at the crossing were not effective in ensuring reliable performance of the equipment. In addition, the train operator\u2019s briefing material did not clearly explain to drivers their role in respect of failures at this type of level crossing. RAIB has identified four key learning points relating to non-provision of the automatic warning system at locations where it is mandated by standards, recording of the condition of assets during inspection, storage of batteries, and involving people with relevant technical expertise in industry investigations into incidents and accidents. RAIB has made four recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail addressing the indications given to train drivers approaching crossings where they are required to monitor the crossing\u2019s status, improvements to the reliability of power supplies to crossings such as Butterswood and considering remote monitoring of the power supply at similar crossings. One recommendation has been made to First TransPennine Express regarding the briefing that it gives its drivers on this type of level crossing.

The train involved was operated by Arriva Trains Wales and consisted of two 2-car units. It was travelling at 120 km/h (75 mph) at the time of the collision. The train was running from Birmingham International to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli and there were 140 passengers and two crew members on board. On the day of the accident, the farm crossing was being used by tractors bringing in a harvest from fields on the opposite side of the line to the farm. The farmer had appointed a contractor to carry out the harvesting operation, and an attendant had been provided at the crossing to phone the signaller and operate the gates. The accident occurred because the system of work in use at the crossing was inherently unsafe, leading to ineffective control of road vehicle movements over the crossing and frequent use of the crossing without the signaller being contacted. This system broke down. There were also underlying management factors: RAIB has made three recommendations: RAIB has also noted a learning point from an observation made during the investigation concerning the prolonged closure of an adjacent level crossing on a main road after the accident. Response to recommendations: the harvest contractor did not implement an effective safe system of work at the crossing Network Rail\u2019s process for risk assessment of these types of crossing did not adequately deal with periods of intensive use Network Rail\u2019s instructions to users of these crossings did not cover periods of intensive use. main line infrastructure managers should improve the risk assessment process at these crossings to take into account the increased risk during periods of intensive use main line infrastructure managers should define safe and practical methods of working to be adopted at these crossings during periods of intensive use RSSB should update the level crossing risk management toolkit to reflect the changes brought about by the second recommendation. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},

He was part of a team of three carrying out ultrasonic inspection of two sets of points at Newark South Junction and was acting in the role of lookout. The accident happened around 70 metres south of the platforms at the station. A few minutes before the accident, the lookout and two colleagues arrived at the yard adjacent to the tracks in a van. One colleague was in charge of carrying out the inspections and the other, the \u2018controller of site safety\u2019 ( ), was in overall charge of the safety of the team. They had planned to carry out the inspections on lines that were still open to traffic in accordance with a pre-planned safe system of work. All three had many years of relevant experience in their respective roles and were familiar with the work site. Upon arrival at the yard, the lookout and tester proceeded to the track to start the inspection work; the   remained in the van. Shortly after they had started the inspection, the 10:08 hrs London to Newark North Gate passenger service approached. It was due to stop in platform 3, which required it to negotiate two sets of crossovers. The train blew a warning horn and the two staff on site acknowledged the warning and moved to the nominated place of safety. However, just before the train moved onto the first crossover, the lookout turned to face away from the train, walked towards the station and then out of the position of safety. He moved to a position close to where he had been before the train approached, most probably to check for trains approaching in the opposite direction, having decided that the approaching train was proceeding straight into platform 1. Although the train braked and blew a second warning horn, the lookout did not turn to face the train until it was too late for him to take evasive action. RAIB has made two recommendations and identified a learning point. The recommendations are addressed to Network Rail and relate to: The learning point relates to improving the implementation of Network Rail\u2019s competence assurance process by providing training and sufficient working time to enable front line managers to implement the associated procedures as intended by Network Rail. Report 01/2015 - Published 16/02/2015 Response to recommendations: improving work site safety discipline and vigilance, especially for teams doing routine work with which they are familiar improving the implementation of Network Rail\u2019s procedures for planning safe systems of work so that the method of working that is chosen minimises the risk to track workers so far as is reasonably practicable, as intended by the procedure.

{"title": "\n    Report 02/2015: Derailment at Stoke Lane Level Crossing\n  ", "text": "On 27 August 2013, at around 04:27 hrs, a freight train derailed by two axles as it traversed Stoke Lane level crossing on the Newark to Nottingham line.The train was travelling at a speed of 53 mph (85 km/h) when the trailing wheelsets of the 26th and 28th wagons derailed. Consequential damage to the rear of the train resulted in an air leak and the automatic application of the brakes. The train came to a stop after around 1.3 km, at Carlton station. The wagons remained upright and in line, and did not foul the adjacent running line. There was no leakage of diesel fuel from any of the tank wagons. The track was damaged by the derailed wheelsets for a distance of around 800 metres. The driver was not injured. The railway remained closed for repairs until 15:30 hrs on 8 September 2013. The immediate cause of the derailment was a severe dip in the track which developed rapidly under the leading portion of the train. After the derailment, severe dips of about 100 mm were found in both rails of the affected line, where the rails had deformed over a large void in the ground which had left the track unsupported over a length of around 3 metres. The void under the railway and other voids found later under the adjacent road surface were caused by excessive ground loss during the recent construction of a microtunnel along the road centre line. RAIB\u2019s investigation has interpreted the available evidence in order to identify the most likely cause of the voids. Although some alternative explanations cannot be completely discounted, RAIB considers that the most likely explanation for the ground loss is that it was as a result of overmining of the ground during the construction work. RAIB\u2019s investigation identified safety lessons, both for those in the construction industry who build undertrack crossings and also for the railway regarding managing asset protection processes for such constructions. In line with the RAIB\u2019s remit, the improvement of railway asset protection processes to prevent recurrence has been the focus of its investigation. This is reflected in the balance of the recommendations made, which relate to the following areas: Response to recommendations: disseminating key learning points arising from this accident to the UK tunnelling industry, via the Health and Safety Executive and relevant industry bodies improving Network Rail\u2019s asset protection standard for construction of under track crossings so that there is one unified standard applicable to both outside parties and Network Rail improving the technical knowledge of Network Rail\u2019s asset protection engineers about under track crossings and increasing the time and technical assistance available to them to adequately assess risks and review documentation submitted by outside parties reviewing the suitability of the action limits in Network Rail\u2019s standard for monitoring track movement over or adjacent to civil engineering works, including under track crossings.

{"title": "\n    Report 03/2015: Derailment at Paddington station\n  ", "text": "At around 05:20 hrs on Sunday 25 May 2014, the third vehicle of an empty five car class 360/2 passenger train manufactured by Siemens and operated by Heathrow Express derailed while it was running along platform 3 at London Paddington station. All four wheels on the leading bogie of the third vehicle became derailed on a track defect which, according to Network Rail\u2019s standards, required a repair within 36 hours. No one was injured as a result of the derailment. The derailment occurred because the bogies of the third vehicle were incorrectly set up, which resulted in the left-hand wheels of the leading bogie being partially unloaded even when stationary. The track defect along platform 3 exacerbated this unloading and contributed to the derailment. The investigation has found that the incorrect setup was the result of the repeated implementation by Siemens technicians of a procedure aimed at setting the vehicle ride heights following tyre turning or bogie replacement. This procedure did not clearly instruct the technicians on how to adjust one of the bogie components (the anti-roll bar) which resulted in the technicians setting it in such a way as to create the wheel load imbalance. None of the checks in the procedure identified the incorrect setup because these checks were not monitoring parameters likely to provide a clear indication of a wheel load imbalance. An underlying factor was the lack of effective transfer of design information about the role and importance of the anti-roll bars between the vehicle designers (Siemens Germany) and the vehicle maintainers (Siemens UK). The track defect had been repeatedly identified by Network Rail\u2019s measurements of track geometry for at least three years. However the required processes to remedy the defect were not followed and this was not picked up by Network Rail\u2019s assurance process. As a result of this investigation, the RAIB has made four recommendations to Siemens and one to Network Rail. The recommendations to Siemens relate to the revision of the procedure used to set the vehicle ride heights, training materials and competence assessments to capture the function of anti-roll bars, their method of adjustment and the risks associated with incorrect setup. The recommendations also cover a review of other maintenance procedures and a review of the effectiveness of Siemens\u2019 recently developed processes for transfer of design information into maintenance procedures. The recommendation on Network Rail is to review its supervision and self-assurance arrangements to identify shortcomings which led to the non-compliances with a mandated standard going unnoticed. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 04/2015: Runaway and collision near to Loughborough Central station\n  ", "text": "At approximately 12:35 hrs on 12 May 2014, an unmanned train ran away for a distance of around 1.8 miles (2.9 km) before colliding with a set of unattended coaches. The collision occurred about 450 metres south of Loughborough Central station, located on the Great Central Railway. This is a heritage railway, and no train services for public use were being operated on the day of the accident. Nobody was injured as a result of the collision, although significant damage was sustained by some of the rail vehicles involved. The train which ran away had been previously left unattended within a possession on a main line opposite Quorn signal box. The railway at Quorn is on a gradient which descends towards Loughborough. The train which ran away consisted of a locomotive coupled to a single coach. RAIB\u2019s investigation found that, before the train was left unattended, the air brakes on the locomotive had been applied by the driver and a single wheel scotch had been positioned against one of the locomotive\u2019s wheels by a member of staff. The handbrakes on the locomotive were not applied and the coach was not secured with either brakes or a wheel scotch. RAIB has concluded that the train ran away because the wheel scotch was positioned against the locomotive\u2019s wheel in a way which made it ineffective. The RAIB determined that the handbrakes on the locomotive, had they been used, would have provided sufficient braking force to have held the train. The driver did not apply the locomotive\u2019s handbrakes because he believed that they were not effective on this class of locomotive and that the wheel scotch would provide sufficient braking force, should the pressure in the air braking system leak away. The driver may also have been influenced by the prevailing practices on the railway which related to the use of handbrakes. The train was not left in a location where it would have been protected from running away by the arrangement of the infrastructure. This was probably because the staff involved thought that these locations were either not available or needed disproportionate time to access. It may also have been because they had a reduced perception of the risks of leaving trains unattended outside of these locations.\nRAIB found that checks by the Great Central Railway\u2019s managers did not detect the full-extent of the unsafe and non-compliant practices present within possessions. The investigation also found that some of the rules relating to the way in which rail vehicles were to be left unattended were inconsistent and potentially unclear. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has identified two key learning points. These are: that the movement of trains not connected by a continuous automatic brake or which do not include a brake van under the control of a guard should be avoided; and that safety critical activities must be undertaken by an adequate number of staff holding the correct competencies.\nRAIB has also made four recommendations addressed to the Great Central Railway. These relate to: ensuring that activities which result in trains being left unattended are subject to effective risk controls; implementing the railway\u2019s safety management system to ensure that its requirements relating to the training and assessment of staff are effective; ensuring that non-compliances and unsafe practices are detected in the future; and ensuring that the Great Central Railway has effective oversight of the maintenance being undertaken on diesel locomotives operating on its infrastructure.

{"title": "\n    Report 05/2015: Fatal accident at Frampton level crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 18:45 hrs on Sunday 11 May 2014, a passenger train approaching the village of Frampton Mansell, in Gloucestershire, struck a motorcycle on Frampton level crossing. The rider of the motorcycle was fatally injured. The train did not derail, and there were no reported injuries to anyone on the train. The rider was crossing the railway on a trail bike, a type of motorcycle designed for use on public roads and for off-road use. He was the last of a group of three riders who had reached the level crossing along an unsurfaced track leading from a minor road near the village of Sapperton. Signage on the approach to the crossing instructed vehicle users (which would include trail bike riders) to use a telephone located close to the crossing. This allowed the railway signaller to tell users whether it was safe to cross the railway. The riders did not use the telephone because they believed that they could cross safely by looking for trains before crossing, and because the signs did not grab their attention sufficiently for them to read the information on them. The riders did not know that a curve in the railway meant that they could not rely on seeing an approaching train early enough to decide whether it was safe to cross. The train\u2019s warning horn was sounded as it approached, but the trail bike riders could not hear this because they were wearing full-face crash helmets and their trail bike engines were noisy. Network Rail had received some information that trail bikers were using the crossing, but had not taken effective action to manage the associated risk of unsafe use. Although permitted to use vehicles on both approaches to the level crossing, the trail bike riders were unaware they were not among the people permitted to use vehicles on the crossing. The signs giving instructions to vehicle users did not explain this, and there was no other indication at the crossing, or on the approaches. There was no requirement for signs or other indications to be provided by Network Rail, or any other organisation, to indicate that the general public were not permitted to take vehicles onto the level crossing. The investigation identified three observations, unrelated to the accident, relating to level crossing signage, correct sounding of train warning horns and provision of reliable images from CCTV cameras fitted to trains. The RAIB has made six recommendations. Four addressed to Network Rail, one addressed to the ORR and one addressed to the Department for Transport relate to improved content and positioning of information provided to level crossing users. Two recommendations addressed to Network Rail require it to seek a better understanding of actual (not only permitted) use of level crossings, and, in conjunction with highway authorities, to raise public awareness of locations where the general public are not permitted to take vehicles onto level crossings. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 06/2015: Serious accident near Redhill\n  ", "text": "At about 10:41 hrs on 24 June 2014, a track worker was struck by a passenger train travelling at about 80 mph (129 km/h), near Redhill. The accident occurred on a section of the main line between Brighton and London known as the Up Quarry line. He was the leader of a team of twelve people who were fitting emergency clamp plates to lengths of rail where cracks had been identified during an earlier inspection. The accident happened on the top of an embankment about ten metres high, on a section of line where trains can travel at up to 90 mph (145 km/h). The team were doing the work of fitting clamp plates to one of the two lines at the site while trains continued to run on both lines. They were protected by lookouts, whom the controller of site safety (COSS) had positioned at the site and at some distance away on both sides of the site of work, to warn the team of the approach of a train in sufficient time for them to stop work and move to a position of safety before the train arrived. At the time the accident occurred, the work had been in progress for about forty minutes. The other members of the team had completed their work, and the team leader was engaged in taking measurements for the lengths of replacement rail that would be required at the site. The lookouts had warned the team of the approach of a southbound train, and a short time after this had passed, and before the COSS had given permission for anyone to return to the track, the lookouts gave another warning, for a northbound train. At about the time this warning was given, the team leader began to walk along the side of the line, with his back to the approaching northbound train. As he walked, he moved closer to the Up Quarry line, and the train struck him on his right shoulder and threw him down the side of the embankment. Other members of the team gave him first-aid treatment and called the emergency services, and an air ambulance helicopter landed on the railway. The casualty was airlifted to hospital, but he had suffered life-changing injuries. The RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the position of safety the team were using was not adequate because there was no level place to stand, clear of the line. The team leader was unaware of the imminent danger from the approaching train. The RAIB has identified three learning points and made three recommendations arising from this investigation. The learning points relate to staff speaking up if they feel unsafe, the need for train drivers to sound a warning as they approach each group of workers who are on or near the track, and the importance of first-aid training for staff working in high-risk areas. The recommendations are all addressed to Network Rail and cover suitable lineside positions of safety, the company\u2019s policy on first aid at work, and the training of people who act as lookouts.

{"title": "\n    Report 07/2015: Severe injury sustained at Sutton Weaver\n  ", "text": "At 19:04 hrs on 23 September 2014, a train driver received a severe electric shock at Sutton Weaver, Cheshire. He had stopped his train having seen damaged overhead power supply wires ahead of it. Following a call to the signaller, he left his train and came close to, or made contact with, an electrically live wire which had broken and was low hanging. The train driver suffered serious injuries. This accident occurred because one of the overhead wires had broken, was hanging down and was electrically live. Two previous trains had come into contact with this hanging wire and consequently tripped the power supply circuit breakers. Each time the circuit breakers had been reset by the Electrical Control Operators in accordance with procedures to make the overhead wires electrically live again. The driver had left the train to obtain information as to his location to assist in restoring train services as he was trained to do, but did not see the broken wire. The investigation found that the wire broke as some of its strands had fractured due to fatigue, likely initiated and progressed from a high stress area related to an attachment supporting the overhead wire. The RAIB has made two recommendations. One is for Network Rail to extend the scope of its detailed overhead line examinations to inspect for signs of wire damage at these attachment positions. The other recommendation is for RSSB, who are the custodian of the railway Rule Book, to review whether clarification is needed relating to the actions that train crew should take if they are required to leave a train where the OLE is known to be damaged and still live. Following a review of the actions of those involved in attending to the injured driver, one learning point has been made reminding train operators of the importance of contacting the signaller by the quickest means in emergency situations. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 08/2015: Near miss at Hest Bank\n  ", "text": "During the afternoon of 22 September 2014, a group of nine track workers repairing a section of the West Coast Main Line south of Hest Bank level crossing, near Lancaster, narrowly avoided being struck by a southbound passenger train.  Their site of work was located on a bend which restricted visibility of approaching trains.  Warning of approaching trains was intended to be given by lookouts, located remotely with good visibility of the track, using a radio-based lookout operated warning system (LOWS).  The system had been working normally prior to the incident, but the workgroup did not receive a warning for the incident train. The track workers saw the approaching train with just enough time to clear the track before it passed them while travelling at 98 mph (158 km/h).  They were shaken by the incident, but not physically injured.  All work on the site was stopped for the remainder of the shift. The incident was caused because a lookout did not give a warning, either because he operated the wrong switch on his radio transmitter by mistake, or because he forgot about the need to send a warning during an intended delay period between seeing the train and operating the warning switches.  This delay was because he was positioned on a long section of straight track and could see approaching trains for significantly longer than the time required for the workgroup to move into a position of safety.  A previous RAIB recommendation intended to mitigate this risk had not been implemented due to administrative errors.  It is probable that the lookout\u2019s vigilance had degraded as he had been working continuously for almost two hours.  Although unrelated to the incident, the RAIB identified that a safety-critical element of the LOWS circuitry was not subject to routine testing. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail covering the management of working time for tasks which depend on vigilance, and the circumstances in which LOWS should be used. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 09/2015: Parting of live overhead wire at Walkergate\n  ", "text": "At around 18:56 hrs on 11 August 2014, a Tyne and Wear Metro train at Walkergate station, developed an electrical fault in equipment under the rear car, which tripped the power supply to the overhead wire. About a minute later, the power was remotely restored by a power controller and a fire started in the faulty equipment. The fault drew a high current from the overhead wire through the car\u2019s pantograph, causing localised overheating and, after about 18 seconds, the wire parted. The loose ends of the live wire flailed around the train roof, showering sparks, and one end fell on the platform. A second power controller happened to observe events on station CCTV and power to the overhead line was disconnected. The parted overhead wire had remained live for approximately 14 seconds. At the time of the accident, the train doors were closed for departure and there were no passengers on the platform. About 30 passengers got out of the train after the power was turned off. There were no reported injuries, although passengers were evidently distressed. A sustained high current was drawn because the electrical fault occurred in a part of the train\u2019s power circuit which was not protected by on-train equipment and which could only be detected by the overhead power supply protection equipment. However, because of the way that the power was switched back on, the level of current drawn by the fault was not sufficient to immediately activate that protection. The underlying cause of the accident was the ineffective management of risks created at the interface between system components, comprising the power supply, power control and the train. RAIB observed that the arrangements between the infrastructure operator, Nexus, and the train operator, DB Regio Tyne and Wear, did not effectively facilitate the sharing of relevant health and safety information on risks created within the system. It also observed deficiencies in the competence management of the power control function and in the regime for assuring the continued integrity of some electrical protection equipment. RAIB has made three recommendations. The first, addressed to Nexus, seeks improvements in its safety management system to provide a more effective framework for the management of its shared risks. The second, addressed to both Nexus and DB Regio Tyne and Wear, relates to the identification and evaluation of risks created at the interfaces between their organisations. The third recommendation, addressed to both organisations, seeks to achieve more comprehensive power control procedures to facilitate safe decision-making.

{"title": "\n    Report 10/2015: Derailment at Porthkerry\n  ", "text": "At 02:30 hrs on 2 October 2014, a loaded coal train derailed at Porthkerry, between Barry and Rhoose on the Vale of Glamorgan line in South Wales. The last two wagons in the train were derailed when the rail beneath them collapsed. Nobody was injured. The cause of the derailment was the failure of a section of the left-hand rail due to a metallurgical defect within that rail. The defect arose due to impurities within the steel which had been present since manufacture. The rail had been installed at Porthkerry in 2008 but had previously been used at another site. The presence of the defect was not discovered when the rail was installed at Porthkerry. The rail was not replaced before it collapsed due to a combination of factors: visual inspections intended to identify this type of defect had not been carried out, the regular track inspections had not found it and none of the staff responsible for management of the track had identified that the rail needed urgent replacement. The defect that was later to cause the derailment was eventually discovered on 30 July 2014 during an inspection that was being carried out to monitor a different type of rail defect. However, according to Network Rail\u2019s standards, a defect of the type identified did not require urgent attention and therefore a period of 52 weeks was allowed for rail replacement. Consequently no action was taken to address the reported defect before the date of the derailment. RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail concerning the methods used to detect this type of rail defect, the techniques used to assess its severity and assessing the risk posed by similar rail in other locations. RAIB has also identified a learning point for the industry concerning the delegation of inspections by track maintenance engineers.

{"title": "\n    Report 11/2015: Derailment at Angerstein Junction\n  ", "text": "At about 12:15 hrs on 2 April 2014, two wagons of a nominally empty freight train derailed on the approach to Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south east London. The derailed wagons were pulled over the junction and stopped on the Blackheath to Charlton line, with the two wagons partly obstructing the line used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. No other trains were involved in the accident and no-one was injured, but there was significant damage to the railway infrastructure. The wagons derailed because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track. The insufficient load was due to a combination of a track defect, an unevenly distributed residual load in the wagon, and an uneven distribution of load associated with a twisted bogie. The unevenly distributed residual load comprised finely crushed rock which adhered to the side of wagon, and was not discharged by unloading procedures. These procedures had been developed without recognising the derailment risk associated with carrying relatively small, but significantly unbalanced, loads. This combination of factors illustrates the derailment risk which arises when wagons carrying one or more defects are operated on track with one or more defects in circumstances where both wagon and track are compliant with relevant railway standards (ie the defects on wagon and track are not, individually, sufficient to prevent train operations continuing). RAIB has made six recommendations, several of which could be informed by work undertaken as part of a cross-industry programme already initiated by the ORR after previous RAIB investigations identified derailment risks associated with operation of wagons and track which are imperfect, but nevertheless compliant with relevant standards. \nOne recommendation addressed to Aggregate Industries seeks improved wagon load discharge arrangements. Two recommendations addressed to RSSB are intended to mitigate risks associated with imperfect wagons, carrying unevenly distributed loads, on imperfect track. Three recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, seek appropriate control of derailment risk in sidings where derailed vehicles can affect running lines, provision to wagon operators of wagon defect information collected by trackside equipment, and possible modifications to the method of collecting track twist data in order to reflect the effect of this track defect on modern rolling stock.

Two track workers rode on the ironmen as far as Raven level crossing (a distance of about one mile) in order to shout a warning to colleagues who were working there; the warning provided just enough time for their colleagues to get clear of the line. The two track workers received minor injuries when they jumped off the ironmen just before the crossing. The track workers were unable to control the speed of the ironmen on the descending gradient towards Raven level crossing. The incident occurred due to a combination of the planning of the work, the control of the work, the speed at which the ironmen were travelling and the performance of the ironmen\u2019s brakes. RAIB has made six recommendations. One recommendation to Network Rail, in conjunction with RSSB and the M&E Engineers Networking Group, to improve the design and testing of the brakes of manually propelled plant. It has made three recommendations to Network Rail relating to the planning of work using manually propelled plant, arrangements for compliance with the requirements of the Rule Book, and measures to mitigate the risk of runaway of manually propelled plant.

{"title": "\n    Report 14/2015: Class investigation \u2013 protection irregularities\n  ", "text": "The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has investigated a number of accidents involving track workers on Network Rail\u2019s infrastructure and has identified track worker safety as an area of particular concern in recent annual reports. RAIB has also become concerned at the number of operating irregularities associated with the protection of those carrying out engineering work, particularly where protection was planned to block the line to traffic. This is because, in different circumstances, these irregularities could have led to harmful, and possibly fatal, outcomes. RAIB observed the regular occurrence of these operating irregularities in the daily incident reports \nproduced by Network Rail\u2019s National Operations Centre. As a result, it decided to collect information over a two-year period (April 2011 to April 2013) to understand more. This report describes analysis that the RAIB has carried out based on this information, and its investigation of the safety issues that this identified. The data analysis showed that most of the reported operating irregularities were potentially harmful and that their occurrence was neither infrequent nor reducing. A systematic review of these was then undertaken to identify the various safety issues that would need to be addressed to prevent them occurring and leading to harm. RAIB is aware that Network Rail is currently planning and implementing a major track safety initiative known as \u2018Planning and Delivering Safe Work\u2019 (PDSW). The investigation has sought to understand this and has established that Network Rail intends that PDSW will address a number of the safety issues identified. However, RAIB has observed that the initiative is currently only in the early stages of implementation and that the envisaged benefits have yet to be demonstrated. It has also observed that the initiative is intentionally focused on the roles of those working on site. This means that it will not have significant benefits in areas where risks may be created by people in a number of other roles that are important in safeguarding those carrying out work on the railway. RAIB has made two recommendations addressed to Network Rail. They are concerned with: Response to recommendations: monitoring and verifying the benefits obtained from the PDSW initiative developing an action plan to reduce the risks associated with railway roles that are outside the scope of the PDSW initiative. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 15/2015: Collision with a collapsed signal post at Newbury\n  ", "text": "At about 14:35 hrs on 17 November 2014, a train travelling at 110 mph (177 km/h) struck the top of a signal which had collapsed and fallen across the railway line near Newbury. The signal post completely obstructed one track and partially obstructed a second (the one on which the train was travelling). There were no injuries and the train did not derail, but it did sustain some exterior damage. The outcome could have been much more serious if the first train to encounter the collapsed signal had been travelling at speed on the completely obstructed track. The signal collapsed because the base of the post, which was of hollow tubular steel construction, had corroded through, causing an almost complete loss of wall thickness at and just above ground level. Corrosion had occurred to both internal and external surfaces; internally because water had entered the post and there was no drainage for it to escape, while the external corrosion was affected by the base being buried in ballast, which held water around the base and damaged the protective coating on the signal post. Signal posts are subject to annual visual examinations, but the examinations of this signal did not detect the problem because the main area of corrosion was hidden by ballast, and the examinations regime was vulnerable to missing such defects. A separate examination in 2012 for a resignalling project in the area also did not detect the defect for similar reasons. Because the defect was not detected, it was not reported and remedied through maintenance. The investigation also identified possible underlying factors associated with the management of ballast levels around post bases, competence management of structures examiners and corporate knowledge about the original design specifications for signal structures. As a consequence of this investigation RAIB has made five recommendations. Four of the recommendations are addressed to Network Rail and cover the management and examination of signal structures and their resistance to such failures. The fifth recommendation is addressed to Amey regarding its competence management arrangements for structures examiners. RAIB has also identified a learning point relating to the process for conducting visual examinations on structures such as signal posts. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2015: Platform struck by trains at Moston\n  ", "text": "At about 06:06 hrs on 28 January 2015, the 03:57 hrs freight service from Warrington Arpley yard to Doncaster struck platform supports along the edge of the down platform at Moston station, near Manchester. This displaced other parts of the platform structure which were then struck, at about 06:17 hrs, by the 06:12 hrs passenger service from Manchester Victoria to Leeds. There were no injuries but both trains suffered minor damage. The freight train struck the platform structure because spigots intended to secure containers to a wagon, were projecting beyond the permitted width of the wagon. It is not known when the spigots were moved to this position, but closed circuit television (CCTV) evidence indicates that they left Warrington in this condition. The wagon design did not include a physical restraint to prevent the spigots being left in this position, but a member of staff at Warrington Arpley yard was required to check that they were correctly stowed. It is uncertain why this person did not notice the incorrect stowage; possibilities include concentrating on other aspects of his work and the difficulty of distinguishing the wrongly positioned spigots from the similarly coloured side of the wagon. It is unlikely that the accident would have occurred if the spacing between Moston Down platform and the adjacent track had met current criteria for new platforms. A high proportion of Network Rail platforms do not meet these criteria and, since 2009, continued use has been permitted where there has been no indication of significant risk. It is possible that historical movements of the platform are at least part of the reason for the tight clearances at Moston, but there has been no significant movement since January 2009. Although not related to the accident, the RAIB observed shortcomings in the Network Rail process for identifying such movements. The RAIB investigation has identified one learning point relating to the importance of checking that nothing projects beyond permitted limits before wagons commence journeys. RAIB has made two recommendations. The first, addressed to operators of container wagons, aims to prevent spigots being left in an unsafe position or, if this is not practicable, using paint or alternative means to ensure that incorrectly stowed spigots are easily seen. The second recommendation is addressed to Network Rail and requires that it provides effective processes for identifying platforms at which the distance to the adjacent track is reducing gradually. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 18/2015: Arcing and fire at Windsor & Eton Riverside\n  ", "text": "On the evening of 30 January 2015, the 19:53 hrs South West Trains service from Windsor & Eton Riverside to London Waterloo left its origin station on time. After the train had travelled about 400 metres, there was a small explosion under the sixth carriage, followed by about 22 seconds of severe electrical arcing. The train, which was formed of two class 458/5 electric multiple units (ten carriages), was travelling at about 14 mph (23 km/h) at the time. The brakes applied because of damage to air pipes, and the train stopped very rapidly. Some smoke entered the carriages through ventilators. There were two passengers in the sixth carriage, and they moved quickly into another part of the train. The driver contacted the signaller by radio to ask for the electric power to be switched off. While he was doing this, the floor of the sixth carriage was penetrated by fire, and smoke rapidly filled the vehicle. A few minutes after this, the lights in the rear five carriages went out. There were 19 passengers on the train. Some of them operated the emergency door release in the rear carriage, got down onto the track, and walked back to Windsor station. Railway staff later evacuated the remaining passengers to the track, and helped them walk back to the station. The fire brigade were called, and confirmed by 20:50 hrs that the fire was out. None of the passengers were hurt, but the guard of the train was taken to hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. The fire occurred because a joint between three power cables, located under the floor of the sixth carriage, had not been secured correctly when the carriage was reassembled after being rebuilt and refurbished in 2014. Electrical arcing had developed at the loose joint, and this damaged the ends of the cables and eventually led to the arcing which badly damaged the structure of the train. This in turn caused a fire that penetrated the floor. RAIB has made four recommendations. One, addressed to Wabtec Rail Ltd, covers the review and improvement of quality assurance arrangements at the factory where the refurbishment work was done. The second, addressed to Network Rail, relates to the need for changes to the rules relating to the conditions under which passengers are evacuated from trains after incidents. The third and fourth, addressed to South West Trains, concern the way in which the emergency lighting on the trains is configured to operate in the event of a loss of external power, and the need to review the risks associated with power cables and the joints between them. The investigation also identified four learning points for the railway industry, relating to the design of electrical junction boxes, the need for train crew to be fully aware of how on-train equipment works, the organisation of train conversion projects, and the importance of ensuring that records relating to train design are accurate and kept up-to-date. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 16/2015: Derailment at Heworth\n  ", "text": "At about 15:25 hrs on 23 October 2014, a freight train derailed just after passing through Heworth station on the railway line from Sunderland to Newcastle. It was travelling at 51 mph (82 km/h) when the leading wheelset of the tenth wagon in the train derailed on track with regularly spaced dips in both rails, a phenomenon known as cyclic top. The train continued for about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) where it was stopped by the signaller, who had become aware of a possible problem with the train from damage to the signalling system. By the time the train stopped, all of the wagon\u2019s wheels were derailed and its suspension was damaged. The immediate cause of the accident was a combination of a loss of damping within the suspension on one corner of the wagon that made it susceptible to derailing on the cyclic top track defect it passed over. This was because: Since the derailment, the wagon owner and operator, Freightliner, has carried out additional checks to identify any other wagons with the same worn suspension component and modified the maintenance regime for these wagons.  Network Rail has instructed its staff to always impose an emergency speed restriction for cyclic top defects, which shall remain in place until monitoring has shown that its staff have made an effective repair. RAIB has made five recommendations.  One is directed to Freightliner and covers mitigating the risk of the ride performance on this type of wagon being degraded by worn suspension components. The other four are directed to Network Rail and cover: Response to recommendations: The wagon had a worn suspension component that made its leading left-hand wheel susceptible to unloading and lifting up when responding to dips in the track. The wagon\u2019s maintenance regime had not identified this worn component. The excessive wear was most likely due to misalignment of the wheelset within its suspension. The severity of the dips in the track required Network Rail to impose an emergency speed restriction but no such restriction had been put in place. The cyclic top defect formed due to water in the track not draining away and although the track inspection regime had identified this defect many times, often no repair took place. Occasionally the local Network Rail track maintenance team carried out manual repairs but these were ineffective. The local Network Rail track maintenance team was unable to cope with the volume of work it had to do. This was due to insufficient numbers of track maintenance staff over a long period of time, changes to the arrangements for working safely while on the track, restrictions on gaining access to the track and changes to how the track was inspected. Network Rail\u2019s management arrangements did not identify the extent of non-compliances to its maintenance processes, or take earlier action to resolve the persistent problems that were affecting track maintenance in this area. investigating why water is not draining from the track where the train derailed reviewing whether defects found by the track inspection regime are being accurately recorded and that corresponding repair work is planned understanding and taking action to address why the track assets in this area consistently have high numbers of defects understanding and taking action to address why Network Rail\u2019s management arrangements allowed the serious non-compliances with track maintenance processes found by this investigation to go undetected over a long period of time.

{"title": "\n    Report 19/2015: Container detachments, Cumbria and Lincolnshire\n  ", "text": "At around 02:20 hrs on 7 March 2015 an empty 30 ft container became detached from a freight train on the West Coast Main Line at Scout Green, Cumbria. It passed over the adjacent track and came to rest down an embankment. There was no damage to the railway infrastructure or to other trains. A sleeper service had passed the site in the opposite direction about four minutes earlier. In a separate incident at around 15:22 hrs on 31 March 2015, an empty 40 ft container was blown from a freight train, near Deeping St Nicholas, Lincolnshire. The container was dragged a short distance by the train, causing extensive damage to the infrastructure, before coming to rest on the adjacent track. There were no passenger services in the area at the time although a freight train had passed the site about five minutes earlier. The container detachments were caused by strong gusting winds combined with the speed of the trains, and a defective design of container retention. The circumstances of these events were very similar to other container detachments at Hardendale and Cheddington in 2008 which were investigated by the RAIB. That investigation report made a number of recommendations which, had they been implemented, would have prevented these further detachments. This report, therefore, makes no further recommendations. However, three learning points have been identified. These relate to the implementation of the previous recommendations and, where risk is mitigated by procedural measures, to the need for the systematic integration of freight operating companies\u2019 operating procedures with Network Rail\u2019s procedures."},
{"title": "\n    Report 20/2015: Unsafe events at Heathrow Tunnel Junction\n  ", "text": "On 27 December 2014, and again on 28 December 2014, track workers were at serious risk of being struck by trains at the Stockley Flyover construction site, on the Heathrow Airport branch line. In the second incident, a train did collide with a small trolley which was being placed on the line by track workers. During the first incident, 14 track workers walked along the open Down Airport line; an area where limited visibility meant that it was unsafe to do this when train services were operating. They mistakenly believed that train services had been stopped. A Heathrow Airport to London service used the line shortly after the workgroup had been warned by other staff and had moved clear. The investigation found that an inappropriate system was used to control access to the track, permitting trains to start operating when track workers could reasonably believe services remained suspended. Staff had also been directed to walk along a line when paperwork showed it was open to traffic. The following day, two track workers were placing a small trolley on the Up Airport line when a train emerged from a nearby tunnel at a speed of 45 mph (72 km/h). The track workers moved clear of the line seconds before the train struck the trolley. There were no injuries and only minor damage. The track workers believed the line was closed, a consequence of being accustomed to working in a way which differed from the mandated site safety system. The two incidents, and other safety shortcomings found, showed that site supervision processes had not identified that deviation from the mandated site safety system had become normal practice. Also, formalised briefings had not been supplemented by any site signage to increase the likelihood of staff being aware of which lines were open. RAIB has made four recommendations, all addressed to Network Rail with some also seeking input from major contractors. The first seeks an improvement in monitoring of railway safety arrangements on major construction site. The second relates to effective monitoring of staff controlling access to worksites. The third seeks to provide workers on major construction sites with additional sources of information about the lines on which it is safe to work. The final recommendation seeks a review, and if necessary improvement, of the railway access control systems used on large construction sites. Three learning points are included to remind engineering supervisors and COSSs that they should comply with safety requirements and query any safety related anomalies in their paperwork. There are two other learning points made which are not directly related to the incidents: a reminder to employers that they should ensure that their staff have received railway rule book updates; and a reminder to those preparing site safety paperwork to make it comprehensive, but concise.

{"title": "\n    Report 01/2016: Derailment at Washwood Heath West Junction\n  ", "text": "At 08:03 hrs on 23 March 2015, one bogie of a wagon derailed on a set of points as it crossed between lines at Washwood Heath West Junction, Birmingham. The bogie ran derailed for 121 metres before re-railing itself as it ran through another set of points. The train driver was not aware of the derailment. The signaller noticed irregular indications on his display panel, stopped the train and asked the driver to examine it. The driver found that the tenth wagon in the train showed signs of having run derailed. The train comprising a locomotive and 24 container wagons had been travelling at 15 mph (24 km/h) while negotiating the series of crossovers. The wagon that derailed was a container-carrying \u2018Megafret\u2019 IKA wagon which consisted of two flat platforms permanently coupled together. The derailment caused significant damage to track and signalling equipment. No-one was injured. The track where the wagon derailed was curved and found to contain a twist fault of a magnitude which Network Rail\u2019s track maintenance standard specified should be rectified within 36 hours. Network Rail was not aware of the existence of this fault at the time. Wagons should be capable of negotiating a track twist of a magnitude which the track standard allows to remain in a line open to traffic. When tested, the wagon which derailed was found not to meet the requirements of the relevant Railway Group Standard for resistance to derailment due to track twist. When examined after the derailment, a component on the centre pivot of the bogie, known as a liner, was found to be worn beyond its maintenance limit. The liner is made from a plastic material and allows relative movement between the body and the bogie. The worn liner had restricted the freedom of the bogie to rotate, increasing its rotational stiffness. The worn liner also caused increased wheel unloading on track twists. Both of these factors reduced the wagon\u2019s ability to resist derailment, causing it to derail when it encountered the track twist on the curved track at this location. The worn liner had not been identified during maintenance of the wagon as the maintenance instructions were unclear about when it should be inspected. Following another derailment, at Doncaster on 11 April 2015, the wagon owner instigated a check of part of its UK fleet which revealed that a number of other wagons of the same type had experienced a similar degree of centre pivot liner wear. RAIB has made three recommendations and four learning points. Two of the recommendations are made to the wagon owners and cover the maintenance procedures for Megafret wagons and the process for dealing with any problems found with the wagons. One recommendation is made to Network Rail and covers the training and briefing of staff on the maintenance of points of the type used at Washwood Heath West Junction. One of the learning points concerns wagon maintenance and three are related to track maintenance.

{"title": "\n    Report 12/2015: Train struck and damaged in Watford Tunnel\n  ", "text": "At around 07:19 hrs on 26 October 2014, train 2K00, the 06:42 hrs Milton Keynes Central to Euston passenger service struck an open door of a lineside equipment cabinet while travelling through Watford Tunnel. The cabinet door detached from its hinges, hitting the side of the train and damaging a door on one of the carriages. The damage to the train door caused a safety circuit to detect that the door was no longer properly closed and the train\u2019s brakes were applied automatically. On examining his train, the driver found that a door on the fourth carriage had been severely damaged. Passengers in this carriage also reported they had been showered by flying glass from the damaged door, although none reported any injuries. RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the cabinet door had opened under aerodynamic forces as the train passed, probably because the door had been left closed, but unsecured, during work that had been taking place on equipment in the cabinet overnight. A number of reasons that may explain why the door had been left unsecured were identified, including poor task lighting, the methods that had been employed during the work overnight, no-one being allocated the responsibility for checking that cabinet doors were closed and secured and the possibility that the staff involved may have been suffering from fatigue, making it more likely that a mistake would be made. An associated underlying factor was that Siemens, the employer of the staff involved, had not fully implemented its policy on fatigue management. The cabinet involved had been installed recently as part of a re-signalling project for the Watford area. It was equipped with two doors with side hinges and had been positioned such that an open door could be struck by a train. An underlying factor was that the risk of this happening had not been identified when this design of cabinet was selected for use in Watford Tunnel. Previous risk assessments undertaken during the period when the cabinet was originally subject to product acceptance were not available to the project team or Henry Williams Ltd, the manufacturer of the cabinet involved. RAIB has made six recommendations. Four recommendations have been made to Network Rail, covering processes for handing back sections of railway after engineering work, its policy on locating lineside equipment in areas of restricted clearance, the design of lineside equipment for areas of restricted clearance and improvements to its product acceptance processes so that previously undertaken risk assessments are available to future users of individual items of equipment. One recommendation has been made to Siemens UK Ltd in respect of the implementation of its policies on staff welfare (including fatigue management), and one recommendation has been made to Henry Williams Ltd in conjunction with Network Rail to make sure that it has full details of the certification of its products used on the railways. RAIB has also identified two learning points. The first relates to the adequacy of task lighting and the need for staff on site to reach a clear understanding about who will be responsible for closing cabinet doors. The second is a reminder of the need for staff involved in projects to implement existing processes for risk assessment and product acceptance. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 02/2016: Collision between a train and a fallen bridge parapet at Froxfield\n  ", "text": "At around 17:31 hrs on 22 February 2015, a high speed passenger train (HST), the 16:34 hrs First Great Western service from London Paddington to Penzance, struck and ran over part of the fallen masonry parapet of an overline bridge at Froxfield, Wiltshire. The train was fully loaded with around 750 passengers and was travelling at a speed of 86 mph (138 km/h) when the driver saw the obstruction. He applied the emergency brake but there was insufficient distance to reduce the speed significantly before the train struck the parapet. The train did not derail and came to a stop around 720 metres beyond the bridge. There were no injuries. The leading power car sustained damage to its leading bogie, braking system, running gear and underframe equipment. The immediate cause of the collision was that the eastern parapet of Oak Hill Road overline bridge had been pushed off and onto the tracks, by a heavy goods vehicle which had reversed into it. The train had not been stopped before it collided with the debris because of delays in informing the railway about the obstruction on the tracks. RAIB has made four recommendations relating to the following: RAIB has also identified two learning points, one for police forces regarding the importance of contacting the appropriate railway control centre immediately when the safety of the line is affected and the other for road vehicle standards bodies and the road haulage industry about the benefits of having reversing cameras or sensors fitted to heavy goods vehicles. Response to recommendations: installation of identification plates on all overline bridges with a carriageway unless the consequence of a parapet falling onto the tracks or a road vehicle incursion at a particular bridge are assessed as likely to be minor enhancing current road vehicle incursion assessment procedures to include consideration of the risk from large road vehicles knocking over parapets of overline bridges (two recommendations) introduction of a specific requirement in a Railway Group Standard relating to the onward movement of a train that is damaged in an incident, so that the circumstances of the incident and the limitations of any on-site damage assessment are fully considered when deciding a suitable speed restriction, especially when there are passengers on board.

{"title": "\n    Report 03/2016: Serious accident at West Wickham station\n  ", "text": "At around 11:35 hrs on 10 April 2015, a passenger was dragged along the platform at West Wickham station, south London, when the 11:00 hrs Southeastern service from London Cannon Street to Hayes (Kent) departed while her backpack strap was trapped in the doors of the train. As it moved off, she fell onto the platform and then through the gap between the platform and train, suffering life-changing injuries. The backpack strap became trapped when the train doors closed unexpectedly and quickly while she was alighting. Testing showed that this potentially unsafe situation could only occur when a passenger pressed a door-open button, illuminated to show it was available for use, within a period of less than one second beginning shortly after the train driver initiated the door closure sequence. RAIB identified this door behaviour, which was not known to the owner or operator, and issued urgent safety advice. In response to this, the railway industry undertook a review which identified 21 other types of train that permit passenger doors to be opened for a short period after door closure is initiated by train crew. The industry is now seeking ways to deal with this risk. The train was being driven by a trainee driver under the supervision of an instructor.  The service was driver only operation, which meant that before leaving West Wickham station, and after all train doors were closed, drivers were required to check that it was safe to depart by viewing CCTV monitors located on the platform.  Two of these monitor images showed that a passenger appeared to be trapped but, although visible from the driving cab, neither the trainee driver nor the instructor was aware of this.  Although the RAIB has not been able to establish why the trapped passenger was not seen before the train departed, a number of possible explanations have been identified. As a result of this accident, RAIB has made two recommendations. The first, addressed to operators and owners of trains with power operated doors, is intended to identify and correct all train door control systems exhibiting the unsafe characteristics found during this investigation. The second, addressed to RSSB, seeks changes to guidance documents so that, where practicable, staff dispatching trains watch the train doors while they are closing, in addition to checking the doors after they are closed. RAIB has also identified five learning points relating to: releasing train doors long enough to allow passengers to get on and off trains safely; effective checking of train doors before trains depart (and not relying on the door interlock light); design of door controls; and use of train driving simulators to raise drivers\u2019 awareness of circumstances when it is not safe to depart from a station.

{"title": "\n    Report 04/2016: Serious accident at Clapham South tube station\n  ", "text": "At around 08:00 hrs on Thursday 12 March 2015, a passenger fell beneath a train after being dragged along the northbound platform of Clapham South station, in south London. She was dragged because her coat had become trapped between the closing doors of a London Underground Northern line train. The train had stopped and passengers had alighted and boarded normally, before the driver confirmed that the door closure sequence could begin. The train operator, in the driving cab, started the door closure sequence but, before the doors had fully closed, one set encountered an obstruction and the doors were reopened. A passenger who had just boarded, and found that the available standing space was uncomfortable, stepped back off the train and onto the platform, in order to catch the following train. The edge of this passenger\u2019s coat was then trapped when the doors closed again and she was unable to free it. The trapped coat was not large enough to be detected by the door control system and the train operator, who was unaware of the situation, started the train moving. While checking the platform camera views displayed in his cab, the train operator saw unusual movements on the platform and applied the train brakes. Before the train came to a stop, the trapped passenger fell to the ground and then, having become separated from her coat, fell into the gap between the platform and the train. The train stopped after travelling about 60 metres. The passenger suffered injuries to her arm, head and shoulder, and was taken to hospital. As a result of this accident, RAIB has made one recommendation, addressed to London Underground, seeking further improvements in the processes used to manage risks at the platform-train interface. RAIB has also identified one learning point for the railway industry, relating to the provision of under platform recesses as a measure to mitigate the consequences of accidents where passengers fall from the platform. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 05/2016: Derailment at Godmersham, Kent\n  ", "text": "At around 21:40 hrs on 26 July 2015, a passenger train derailed after striking eight cows that had gained access to the railway at Godmersham in Kent, between Wye and Chilham stations. There had been a report of a cow on the railway an hour earlier, but a subsequent examination by the driver of the next passing train did not find anything. There were no further reports from other trains that passed before the accident occurred. The train involved in the accident was travelling at 69 mph (111 km/h) at the point of impact. There were 67 passengers on board plus three members of staff; no injuries were reported at the time of the accident. Because the train\u2019s radio had ceased to work during the accident, the driver ran for about three-quarters of a mile towards an oncoming train, which had already been stopped by the signaller, and used its radio to report the accident. The accident occurred because the fence had not been maintained so as to restrain cows from breaching it, and because the railway\u2019s response to the earlier report of a cow on the railway side of the fence was insufficient to prevent the accident. In addition, the absence of an obstacle deflector on the leading unit of the train made the derailment more likely. As a result of this accident, RAIB has made five recommendations addressing the fence inspection process, clarification of railway rules in response to reports of large animals within the boundary fence, the fitting of obstacle deflectors to rolling stock (two recommendations), and the reliability of the train radio equipment. RAIB has also identified two learning points for the railway industry, relating to the railway\u2019s response to emergency situations, including the response to reports of large animals within the boundary fence and the actions to take following an accident.

{"title": "\n    Report 07/2016: Collision between train and tractor at Oakwood Farm User Worked Crossing\n  ", "text": "On 14 May 2015, a passenger train collided with a tractor at Oakwood Farm user worked crossing near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The train was carrying 66 people and travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h), but did not derail. The collision caused the front of the tractor to become detached from its cab. The tractor driver suffered minor injuries, and the train driver was treated for shock. However, in different circumstances the consequences could have been much worse. The tractor driver began crossing the railway after the illuminated warning at the crossing started to display a red light. Oakwood Farm user worked crossing is one of a small number in the country that had been fitted with remotely operated, powered gates. It is likely the tractor driver did not recheck the warning lights after first stopping on the approach to the crossing to press a button to open the gates. This button had not originally been intended to open the gates (it should only have been capable of being used to close them). It was situated at such a distance from the crossing that the time it took for the tractor driver to stop, open the gates and then drive onto the crossing, was greater than the time between the warning light turning red and the arrival of the train. There was no sign at the button to warn the driver to recheck the warning light before going over the crossing. The investigation also found that the warning light was not conspicuous among the many signs present at the crossing. The underlying causes of the accident were that Network Rail did not ensure that the risks at the crossing were adequately mitigated, and that the process for the introduction of the gate operating equipment was adequately managed. As a result of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. The first is to improve the safety at Oakwood Farm user worked crossing and the second is to review the safety of other user worked crossings fitted, or planned to be fitted, with the remotely operated gate opening equipment. The third recommendation is for Network Rail to review the robustness of its processes for introducing new equipment on to its railway infrastructure. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 08/2016: Dangerous occurrence at Wootton Bassett Junction, Wiltshire\n  ", "text": "At around 17:25 hrs on Saturday 7 March 2015, train reporting number 1Z67, the 16:35 hrs steam hauled charter service from Bristol Temple Meads to Southend, passed signal SN45 at danger. Signal SN45, which is situated on the approach to Wootton Bassett Junction, was being maintained at danger to protect the movement of a scheduled passenger train. At the time that the incident occurred, this scheduled passenger train had already passed through the junction. No injuries, damage or derailment occurred as a result of the incident. Train 1Z67 was operated by West Coast Railways and consisted of the steam locomotive \u2018Tangmere\u2019 and 13 coaches. Although Tangmere is a heritage locomotive, it is fitted with modern safety systems including the Automatic Warning System (AWS) and the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS). RAIB\u2019s investigation has found that signal SN45 was passed at danger because the driver did not reduce the train\u2019s speed on approach to the signal. This meant that he was unable to stop the train in time, once he realised it was at danger. The driver had not reduced the train\u2019s speed because he had not seen the preceding signal, which was at caution and should have alerted him that SN45 was at danger. He missed this preceding signal because he had become distracted by activity within the cab and possibly also because he was experiencing a higher workload than normal. Train 1Z67 also passed signal SN45 at danger because the TPWS system was unable to reduce the speed of the train by automatically applying the brakes. This was because TPWS had been rendered ineffective by Tangmere\u2019s crew when they had isolated the AWS system in order to by-pass an automatic brake application which had occurred at a speed restriction. Isolating AWS in this way was in contravention of the relevant rules but the RAIB has found that it had almost certainly become an accepted practice among some train crews on this locomotive. This was probably because warnings from AWS were not always apparent to drivers, who were also anxious to avoid delays resulting from brake demands. Measures intended to prevent the misuse of AWS isolations had either not been adopted by West Coast Railways or had not been effectively implemented. The RAIB found three underlying factors. These were that the AWS system on Tangmere was installed in a way which meant that warnings from the system were not always apparent to drivers. In addition, the investigation found that a speed restriction which was in place on approach to the junction was based on incorrect information and had been implemented in a way which did not conform to the relevant rules and standards.  The investigation also found that West Coast Railways had a weak safety culture and that this had affected the way its staff observed rules and instructions. As a result of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations. One recommendation is addressed to RSSB, working in conjunction with steam train operators and Network Rail, and relates to a review of the arrangements intended to assess, prevent and mitigate the risks associated with steam movements. Three recommendations are addressed to West Coast Railways. These relate to a review of its safety management system and safety culture; the implementation of industry best-practice concerning the management of drivers\u2019 knowledge of operating routes; and the arrangements for maintaining on train data recorders. One recommendation is addressed to Network Rail. This concerns the way that emergency and temporary speed restrictions are designed and implemented. RAIB has identified one key learning point. This is that allowing safety critical systems such as AWS and TPWS to function without improper interference is vital to the safe operation of the railway. By-passing safety systems, or isolating them other than in accordance with the requirements of the relevant rules, can have catastrophic consequences. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report ET2016: Fire on board a freight shuttle in the Channel Tunnel\n  ", "text": "On 17 January 2015, Eurotunnel freight shuttle 7340 departed from the English terminal of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone at 11:57 hrs, conveying 30 vehicles. The wagons of the front portion of the train did not have any roof structures; they were open topped.  The lorry drivers were travelling in an amenity coach located immediately behind the locomotive at the front of the train. At 12:00 hrs, as it was entering the tunnel, the shuttle experienced a loss of electric power from the overhead wires, which caused it to stop.  Three minutes later, once the power was re-established, it set off again.  At around 12:23 hrs a fire was detected on board the shuttle closely followed by a further loss of electric power supply. Three minutes later, the shuttle was brought to a controlled stop.  The shuttle came to rest in the north tunnel beyond the last of two areas dedicated to fire containment, known as SAFE stations. All 42 passengers and crew were safely evacuated into the service tunnel less than 15 minutes after the shuttle stopped.  They were taken to the French terminal of the Channel Tunnel system approximately two hours later. Water walls were set up either side of, and remote from the fire, an hour and a half after the shuttle stopped; these are designed to prevent the fire from spreading to the locomotive and other parts of the train and not to tackle the fire. The fighting of the fire in itself started approximately three and a half hours after shuttle 7340 stopped; the fire was brought under control half an hour later. The joint investigation undertaken by the BEA-TT and the RAIB identified: Eurotunnel has changed its operating procedures for dealing with an overhead power line trip at the tunnel portals on a train comprising of this type of wagon. It now requires the train involved to stop at the first SAFE station for further investigation. As a consequence of this accident, the BEA-TT and the RAIB have made six recommendation to Eurotunnel concerning: The immediate cause of the incident was that an over-height aerial on a lorry got too close to the overhead wires and caused an electrical arc at the entrance to the tunnel at 12:00 hrs.  The aerial had not been detected during the loading operations in the UK. The system provided by Eurotunnel to detect over-height aerials was not sensitive enough to reliably detect thin aerials at typical lorry speeds when they passed in front of the system. The electrical arc started a smouldering fire inside the cab of the lorry concerned. It also caused the initial tripping of the overhead power. Eurotunnel dealt with the power loss as an operational incident, as it was unaware of the smouldering fire. CCTV footage indicated that smoke appeared to be developing inside the cab of the incident lorry when the train came to a stand inside the tunnel following the initial power trip. However, as there was no requirement for the train to be inspected following the overhead power line trip, this early sign of a developing fire was not identified and the train was allowed to restart. The smouldering fire remained undetected until 12:23 hrs when the fire alarms were first activated. When the fire alarms were activated, the train was on the approach to the second SAFE station. Given the speed of the train, it remained technically feasible to bring it to a stop in this SAFE station for at least another 1min 30sec. However, the time taken by the control centre to gather the information to inform the line controller\u2019s decision meant that by the time the decision was taken it was too late to stop the train in the SAFE station. Furthermore, when the second power trip occurred, most probably as a result of a tarpaulin or strap being released by the fire and contacting the overhead power line, the various controllers were focused on the fire procedures and no attempt was made to re-energise the overhead power line which very possibly would have allowed the train to exit the tunnel. It took three and a half hours after the train stopped before the intervention team was ready to start the firefighting activities. Almost an hour was lost in conveying the firefighters from the terminal emergency centre to the site of the fire. This delay was due to a non-optimum use of the service vehicles and their drivers. The incident lorry was loaded on a wagon without any roof protection. This type of wagon had originally been supplied with a roof construction. However, the poor integrity of the roof structure had led to its progressive removal. The safety justifications prepared at the time of the removal of the roofs recognised that the removal of the physical barrier increased the likelihood of electrical arcing and the importance of the aerial detection system, but it did not lead to a review as to whether its sensitivity and reliability were adequate, given the increased risk.  It relied on control measures which, while being positive steps towards the protection of assets and operations, did not address the additional risk to passengers and crew.

{"title": "\n    Report 09/2016: Runaway and collision at Bryn station, Wigan\n  ", "text": "At 00:11 hrs on 27 November 2014 two engineering vehicles (that were part of a new overhead line wiring train) ran away on a gradient close to Bryn station, near Wigan. They collided with two mobile elevating work platforms in the station; seven members of staff who were on and around the work platforms narrowly escaped injury. The two coupled vehicles were a haulage vehicle, an existing item of track maintenance plant, and a specially-adapted wagon, on which the overhead wiring team were located. The driver of the haulage vehicle did not correctly operate the controls to change from a travelling mode to a working mode before he left the cab. This caused the brakes to release and, because it also caused the brake controls on the wagon to become disabled, the wiring team were unable to reapply them. No design, change management, approval or risk assessment work had identified the need for a safety measure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the error. RAIB has identified two underlying factors that help explain why the parties involved had not realised the significance of changes that were proposed to the use of the haulage vehicle. In summary, when developing the new train, they followed a philosophy of minimising technical change and they did not adopt a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and management of requirements and interfaces (a system-based design approach). As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made five recommendations. Three are to Balfour Beatty Rail, the operator of the vehicles, concerning: One recommendation is to RSSB concerns clarification of its guidance to the rail industry concerning the management of changes relating to the design, operation and maintenance of vehicles and plant operating in engineering possessions. One recommendation is to Network Rail to ensure the risks associated with the introduction of new and modified railborne plant are properly managed before such plant is allowed to operate on its infrastructure. Response to recommendations: ensuring improved hazard identification when introducing and operating railborne plant properly assessing and managing the risk implications of making changes to the design and use of its equipment improving the quality of the alterations it makes to electrical systems on its equipment. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 10/2016: Derailment near Angerstein Junction\n  ", "text": "At about 12:10 hrs on 3 June 2015, one wagon of an empty freight train derailed on the approach to Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south east London. The train continued over the junction, derailing two further wagons, before it stopped on the Blackheath to Charlton line. The three derailed wagons were partly obstructing the line used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. No other trains were involved in the accident and no-one was injured, but there was significant damage to the railway infrastructure. The wagons derailed because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track. The insufficient load was due to a combination of the suspension on that wheel being locked in one position, a twisted bogie frame and an intended twist in the track. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made three recommendations. The first, addressed to VTG (the wagon owner), seeks improvements to its wagon maintenance processes. The second, also addressed to VTG, seeks liaison with industry to improve understanding of how wagon suspension wear characteristics relate to maintenance processes. The third, addressed to Network Rail, seeks a review of infrastructure arrangements at the accident location. The report also includes a learning point reinforcing a previous recommendation intended to encourage use of currently available wheel load data to enable identification of wagons with defects or uneven loads that are running on Network Rail\u2019s infrastructure. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 11/2016: Derailment near Langworth\n  ", "text": "At about 14:15 hrs on 30 June 2015, a freight train, conveying 22 empty diesel fuel tank wagons, derailed on a track buckle near Langworth, Lincolnshire. The locomotive and the first ten wagons successfully ran over the buckle before the eleventh and the following nine wagons derailed. Four of these wagons overturned and one came to rest across the adjacent track. No-one was injured and there was no diesel fuel spillage. Extensive damage was caused to the train and to the infrastructure. The investigation found that the track buckled on the hottest day of the year to date because the forces in the rails resulting from thermal expansion exceeded the ability of the ballast to restrain the track. The buckle started at a point where there was an existing misalignment in the track; a feature which reduced its resistance to buckling. The buckle increased under the train because its permitted speed was too fast for the vulnerable condition of the track and the rail temperature on the day. Underlying the accident was a lack of appreciation of the vulnerability of the track to buckling. The under-resourcing of the maintenance team, leading to the continual reprioritisation of maintenance tasks, was also a possible underlying factor. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. The first is to enable improved assessments of the vulnerability of track to buckling on the basis of more accurate data about its ability to withstand thermal expansion. The second is to ensure a more consistent interpretation of risk factors is included in the calculation of rail temperatures at which mitigation measures, such as speed restrictions, should be applied. Two further recommendations relate to local resourcing for track maintenance and managerial oversight of the process of reprioritising or cancelling maintenance tasks. The report has also identified two learning points. The first reinforces the importance of completing records of maintenance interventions that could affect the buckling strength of the rail and investigating any anomalous behaviour of the rail during those interventions. The second relates to checking the security of bolts on a type of switch assembly. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 12/2016: Passenger accident at Hayes & Harlington station\n  ", "text": "At around 13:10 hrs on 25 July 2015, a passenger was dragged along the platform at Hayes & Harlington station, London, when the 11:37 hrs First Great Western service from Oxford to London Paddington departed while her hand was trapped in a door. The passenger, who had arrived on the platform as the doors were about to close, had placed her hand between the closing door leaves. The train driver did not identify that the passenger was trapped and the train moved off, dragging the passenger along the platform. After being dragged for about 19 metres, the passenger lost her footing and fell onto the platform. The passenger suffered head, hand and back injuries. RAIB\u2019s investigation found that the passenger had deliberately placed her hand in the closing door in the expectation that it would re-open as a consequence. RAIB has concluded that after closing the doors of the train, the driver either did not make a final check that it was safe to depart, or that the check was insufficiently detailed to allow him to identify the trapped passenger. The driver may have been misled into thinking that it was safe to depart because a door interlock light in his cab had illuminated, indicating that the doors were closed and locked and he was able to take power. Our investigation identified that the train driver and other railway staff held the same misunderstanding: if someone had a hand trapped in a door it would not be possible for the door interlock light to illuminate and a driver to take power. This is not the case, and the door was found to be compliant with all applicable standards after the accident. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made two recommendations. The first, addressed to RSSB to review, and if necessary extend, its research into the passenger/train interface to understand passenger behaviour and identify means for deterring members of the public from obstructing train doors. The second recommendation is addressed to operators and owners of trains similar to the one involved in the accident at Hayes & Harlington, is intended to continue and expand upon a current review into the practicability of fitting sensitive door edge technology to this type of train. RAIB has also identified three learning points. The first concerns improving awareness among train drivers of the limitations of train door interlocking technology and the importance of the final safety check when dispatching a train. The second concerns the potential for drivers to be distracted by the use of mobile communication devices while driving. The third is aimed at train operators to have the necessary processes in place to identify drivers who are showing signs of sub-standard performance or not engaging positively with measures agreed as part of a Competence Development Plan and the provision of briefing and guidance material for driver managers to enable them to identify behaviours and attitudes which are inconsistent with those expected of train drivers. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 02/2017: Collision at Plymouth station\n  ", "text": "At 15:34 hrs on Sunday 3 April 2016, the 13:39 hrs passenger train service from Penzance to Exeter collided with an empty train which was already waiting in platform 6 at Plymouth station.  The collision occurred at a speed of about 15 mph (24 km/h) and resulted in injuries to 48 people and damage to both trains. The signaller intended that both trains should share the platform because the empty train was to form a service to London and some passengers from the Penzance service were expected to join it.  Lift refurbishment work meant that without platform sharing, passengers would have needed to use the stairs and a subway when changing trains.  Permissive signalling arrangements were in place at Plymouth to permit two trains to share the same platform. The signaller misjudged the amount of space available behind the London train and wrongly believed there was room for the Penzance train.  He was aware that the platform sharing arrangement required an unusual form of permissive working, but did not communicate this to the Penzance train driver, and the rules did not require him to do so. The Penzance train driver incorrectly believed he would not be sharing a platform with the London train.  There was insufficient distance to stop his train by the time he realised his mistake and had applied the emergency brake. Great Western Railway, the operator of both trains, and Network Rail the owner of the infrastructure, had not identified the risk of a collision due to the combination of an unusual form of permissive working, the track alignment on the approach to Plymouth station, and an inexperienced driver. The RAIB has made three recommendations.  The first, addressed to Great Western Railway and possibly also relevant to other train operators, seeks improvements to the training and assessment of new drivers.  The second, also addressed to Great Western Railway and possibly relevant to other train operators, arises from difficulties encountered during passenger evacuation and seeks improvements to emergency door release controls.  The third recommendation, addressed to Network Rail and to be undertaken with the assistance of appropriate train operating companies, seeks a review of permissive working arrangements at stations. Two learning points stress the care needed by drivers when undertaking permissive moves, and the value of preventing passengers boarding or alighting from trains when permissive movements are taking place in the same platform.

{"title": "\n    Report 03/2017: Trains passed over washed out track at Baildon\n  ", "text": "Between 16:29 and 17:58 hrs on 7 June 2016, three passenger trains passed over a section of the single line at Baildon, where part of the supporting embankment had been washed away by flood water.  This left one of the rails unsupported over a length of between 3 and 4 metres.  None of the trains derailed and no one was injured. The washout occurred following a period of intense rainfall between around 15:30 and 16:00 hrs that afternoon. \nA member of the public had noticed the washed out track and had reported it to the local Fire and Rescue Service who had then informed Network Rail shortly before 16:30 hrs.  Around the same time, the driver of a train on that line reported there was flooding in the area, with the water being above the level of the rails.  Network Rail stopped train movements and sent staff to inspect the track at the location reported by the train driver.  The inspection found that the flood water had receded significantly, but did not identify the washout because it was at a different location.  At 17:30 hrs, the line was reopened for use at its normal maximum speed of 50 mph (80 km/h). At 17:45 hrs, a second train passed over the damaged section of track.  The driver did not report any fault, but a call from a member of the public was received by the local police stating they had witnessed this train passing over the unsupported section.  The message was passed to Network Rail, but before the line was again blocked to traffic, a third train passed over it.  This train also had not been stopped from running over the washout.  The driver of this train saw the washout, but was unable to stop his train, passing over it at a speed of 38 mph (62 km/h).  He subsequently stopped the train and made an emergency call to the signaller. These near miss incidents occurred because the reports of the damaged track from members of the public, via the emergency services, were not dealt with appropriately by railway controllers.  The track damage was similar to a previous washout at the same location that occurred in August 2012.  Since that incident, no action had been taken on the recommendations considered by Network Rail to prevent a recurrence. As a result of its investigation, the RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail, relating to: The RAIB has also identified three learning points.  Two are for control office staff about the importance of listening carefully to safety critical messages, and the need to continuously monitor and maintain standards in safety critical communication.  The third is for duty holders, regarding the requirement to inform the RAIB of incidents which, in slightly different circumstances, could have resulted in a more serious outcome. Response to recommendations: measures to minimise the risk of further washouts at Baildon improving the emergency response to incidents on the track by providing Network Rail responders with accurate location information improving the effectiveness of communicating safety critical information between incident controllers, signallers and drivers. RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 13/2016: Freight train collision near Logan\n  ", "text": "On 1 August 2015 at about 11:11 hrs, a freight train travelling within a work site collided with the rear of a stationary freight train at 28 mph (45 km/h). Engineering staff had authorised the driver of the moving freight train to enter the work site at New Cumnock station, travel about 3 miles (4.8 km) to the start of a track renewal site, and bring the train to a stand behind the stationary train. There were no injuries but the locomotive and seven wagons from the moving train and eleven wagons from the stationary train were derailed; the locomotive and derailed wagons were damaged. One wagon came to rest across a minor road. There was also substantial damage to the track on both railway lines. The immediate cause was that the moving train was travelling too fast to stop short of the rear of the stationary train when its driver first sighted the train ahead. This was due to a combination of the train movement in the work site not taking place at the default speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) or at caution, as required by railway rules, and the driver of the moving train believing that the stationary train was further away than it actually was. An underlying cause was that drivers often do not comply with the rules that require movements within a work site to be made at a speed of no greater than 5 mph (8 km/h) or at caution. As a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made four recommendations addressed to freight operating companies. One relates to the monitoring of drivers when they are driving trains within possessions and work sites. Two recommendations relate to implementing a method of formally recording information briefed to drivers about making train movements in possessions and work sites. A further recommendation relates to investigating the practicalities of driving freight trains in possessions and work sites for long distances at a speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) or at other slow speeds, and taking action to address any identified issues. RAIB has also identified three learning points including: Response to recommendations: the importance of providing drivers with all of the information they need to carry out movements in possessions and work sites safely a reminder to provide drivers (before they start a driving duty) with information about how and when they will be relieved the importance of engineering staff giving instructions to drivers through a face to face conversation when it is safe and practicable to do so.

{"title": "\n    Report 04/2017: Collision at Hockham Road user worked crossing, Thetford\n  ", "text": "At 12:30 hrs on 10 April 2016 a passenger train travelling from Norwich to Cambridge collided with an agricultural tractor and trailer on a level crossing at Hockham Road, near Thetford in Norfolk. The train was travelling at 87 mph (140 km/h) when, on the approach to the crossing, the train driver saw a tractor moving closer to the railway tracks. The train driver sounded the train\u2019s horn and applied the emergency brake, but could not stop before colliding with the tractor. The train did not derail, but its driving cab was damaged, and the driver and four passengers suffered minor injuries. The tractor was destroyed, and its driver was seriously injured. The level crossing at Hockham Road is on a restricted byway, and has gates which are operated by crossing users. About one minute before the collision, the tractor driver had obtained permission to cross from a signaller at the Network Rail signal box at Cambridge. The signaller had given him permission to cross when there was insufficient time before the train would arrive at the crossing. This was because the signaller had lost his awareness of the position of the train because his levels of concentration may have lapsed, and his competence to operate the workstation safely and effectively had not been adequately monitored. A system that had been installed at the level crossing in 2012, intended to display green or red lights to crossing users to warn them whether or not it was safe to cross, was not working at the time of the accident. It had been decommissioned by Network Rail following concerns which the company had about the safety integrity of the system. This had meant that users had to telephone the signaller for permission to cross. The RAIB found that Network Rail had not come to a clear understanding with the manufacturer of the system about how the equipment met the required safety integrity level, and having assessed the risks, had decided to turn off the system while improvements were made. An underlying factor was that the arrangements in Cambridge signal box for managing fatigue among signalling staff were inadequate. The RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. The first concerns Network Rail\u2019s approach to managing user worked level crossings, with the intention of either eliminating the need for a signaller to have to decide whether it is safe for a user to cross the railway or providing better information for signallers when making these decisions. The second relates to the processes that Network Rail uses when introducing new signalling equipment whose operating interface differs significantly from existing equipment, and the third covers the management of the competence of signalling shift managers when they also operate signalling equipment.

{"title": "\n    Report 05/2017: Near miss between a train and a track worker, Shawford\n  ", "text": "At 12:22 hrs on 24 June 2016, a train travelling at about 85 mph (137 km/h) narrowly missed striking a track worker near Shawford station, Hampshire. The track worker and a controller of site safety (COSS) had gone onto the railway to locate a reported rail defect. The track worker was not injured but was badly shaken by the incident. After making an emergency stop, the train driver reported the incident and was fit to continue his journey. The immediate cause was that the track worker had become distracted while he was standing on a line on which trains were running. This happened because there was a breakdown in safety discipline and vigilance when the COSS and track worker went onto the railway. Firstly, they did not implement the required safe system of work for going onto the railway at Shawford. Secondly, the track worker crossed the railway without the permission of the COSS. Thirdly, the track worker was distracted and stopped on an open line when crossing back. The RAIB found a similar breakdown in safety discipline and vigilance when it investigated a fatal accident at Newark North Gate (report 01/2015). It is probable that the track worker\u2019s alertness and decision making were affected by fatigue, because he had slept in his car all week to avoid making long journeys to and from home each day. A possible underlying factor was that the rail testing and lubrication section within the Network Rail delivery unit involved was not resilient to any loss of resources or sudden increase in workload. Although not causal to the incident, the RAIB also observed that the way in which the section carried out safe system of work planning for its staff was not compliant with Network Rail\u2019s processes, and neither the COSS nor the track worker reported their involvement in the incident at the time. In addition to a previous recommendation and learning point from the Newark North Gate accident, which also address the key issue of the breakdown in safety discipline and vigilance in this incident, the RAIB has made three new recommendations, addressed to Network Rail. The first relates to the management of fatigue for staff needing to make long journeys before and after a shift. The second relates to making the rail testing and lubrication section of the delivery unit more able to accommodate a short-term loss of resource and peaks in workload. The third recommendation calls for Network Rail to consider the reasons why its management arrangements on Wessex Route did not detect and rectify the non-compliances with the processes for managing the safety of people working on or near the line. The investigation also identified six learning points about: reminding staff of the importance of following existing rules and procedures; how the early use of the train\u2019s horn by drivers to give an urgent warning can avert an accident if track workers on their line do not acknowledge the first horn warning; and the timely reporting of operational incidents. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 06/2017: Fatal accident near David Lane tram stop\n  ", "text": "At 22:57 hrs on 15 August 2016, a member of the public was struck by a tram between David Lane and Basford tram stops on the Nottingham Express Transit ( ) system. The person sustained fatal injuries. The tramway between these two tram stops is not normally accessible to the general public. However, the member of the public had entered the tramway after alighting from a tram at David Lane tram stop. A tram driver had reported seeing the member of the public on this section of the tramway nine minutes before he was struck. The supervisors in the   control room implemented arrangements to warn tram drivers approaching the area between the tram stops. However, after a while, a supervisor formed the opinion that the member of the public had left this area of the tramway and stopped warning drivers between David Lane and Basford tram stops. This meant that the driver of the tram involved was not advised to reduce the tram\u2019s speed or exercise caution in this section. The member of the public was by that time lying motionless along the track. The driver passed through the section at normal speed and could not see the person in time to stop the tram before striking him. The misunderstanding happened because the supervisor thought he understood from a reporting call handled by another supervisor that the member of the public had reached Basford tram stop. The audio reception of the call was poor and the basic principles of safety critical communication were not followed during the call. Furthermore, there was no effective exchange of information between the supervisors and the misunderstanding was not detected and challenged by others in the control room. In light of the actions already taken by Nottingham Trams Limited since the accident, the RAIB has made only one recommendation which relates to  \u2019s on-going culture change programme. In addition, the RAIB has raised two learning points: one relating to using the full beam setting on trams and the other on the importance of effective safety critical communications.

{"title": "\n    Report 07/2017: Track workers class investigation\n  ", "text": "The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has investigated a number of accidents involving track workers on Network Rail\u2019s infrastructure and has identified track worker safety as an area of particular concern in recent annual reports.  This report describes the RAIB\u2019s investigation into the safety of track workers working outside possessions of the line (ie those cases in which the normal running of trains has not been blocked to allow engineering work to be carried out).  It follows the publication in 2015 of the RAIB\u2019s report into irregularities with protection arrangements during infrastructure engineering work. Five recommendations have been made to Network Rail.  These cover Response to recommendations: improvements in procedures and/or training for those in leadership roles to be able to adapt to changes in circumstances improvements to the training of track workers in non-technical skills changes in the competence requirements for people who lead track work in higher-risk situations making location-specific photographic and video information more easily available to staff involved in planning and leading work on the track improvements in the collection, analysis and reporting of information on incidents involving track workers RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 05/2018: Explosion inside an underframe equipment case at Guildford\n  ", "text": "At approximately 14:37 hrs on 7 July 2017, an explosion occurred in an underframe equipment case on train 2G44, the 14:37 hrs Guildford to London Waterloo service, as it was about to depart from platform 2 at Guildford station. The explosion resulted in debris being ejected onto other platforms and a car park near the station. There were no injuries to passengers or staff. There was damage to the train, and to station furniture. The explosion was caused by an accumulation of flammable gases within the traction equipment case under one of the coaches of the train. The gases had been generated following a failure within a large electrical capacitor located within the equipment case. The capacitor failure was caused by a manufacturing defect. The traction equipment on this train had been recently retrofitted, replacing older equipment with a modern version. The failed capacitor was part of this replacement equipment. The design and installation of this new equipment was managed by a project team which had not adequately considered the risk of explosion caused by a capacitor with a manufacturing defect. Consequently, the train did not have any engineering safeguards to prevent such an explosion. As a result of the investigation, the RAIB has made one recommendation to UK train operating companies and the suppliers of their rolling stock. The recommendation relates to reviewing the design of electric traction systems in their fleets to check that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent similar potentially harmful explosions and address any shortcomings identified. The RAIB has also identified six learning points. These cover project risk management, the need for thorough investigations following technical failures, ensuring that accurate and complete records of serious failures are maintained, and ensuring that procurement specifications for future rolling stock takes into account the findings of this investigation. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses"},
{"title": "\n    Report 06/2018: Passengers struck by a flying cable at Abergavenny (Y Fenni) station\n  ", "text": "At about 18:05 hrs on 28 July 2017, as a northbound passenger train entered Abergavenny (Y Fenni) station, a cable drooping from the station footbridge became caught on the train\u2019s roof. The train dragged the cable and caused it to be pulled from the footbridge until its end broke free from a distribution cabinet. Once free, the end of the cable struck a group of passengers on the footbridge stairs and caused minor injuries to three of them. A member of station staff who was on the platform, close to the footbridge, was nearly struck by the cable. The accident also caused damage to cabling running over the footbridge, the station buildings, and a signal at the end of the platform. The cable, which provided the signal box at Abergavenny with its electrical power supply, had become detached from the cable tray running over the footbridge and was drooping down to the extent that it was foul of the train. It then caught on an antenna fixed to the roof of the rear vehicle. The cable was drooping because the nylon cable ties used to attach it to the cable tray had broken. The RAIB found that the cable had not been inspected periodically as required for electrical installations and the drooping cable was not identified during footbridge inspections. It was not reported during routine station safety checks, or after it was drooping below the bottom of the footbridge. An underlying cause was that Network Rail had no controls in place for the management of low voltage electrical supply cables that cross operational railway lines via its overline structures. The RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. The first calls for the replacement of the existing cable tray running over the footbridge at Abergavenny with a solution that will reduce the risk of cables hanging down. The second relates to documenting and implementing controls for the management of cables that cross operational railway lines via structures at stations. The third is to identify cables at stations that have the potential to droop over the operational railway and be struck by a train, and ensure that the responsibility for testing and inspecting these cables is documented. The RAIB has also identified two learning points which relate to the importance of staff identifying drooping cables during safety checks and staff reporting any cables they see that are drooping or hanging down over the operational railway."},
{"title": "\n    Report 07/2018: Fatal accident at Trenos footpath crossing near Llanharan\n  ", "text": "At around 15:50 hrs on 1 June 2017, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train travelling from Cheltenham Spa to Maesteg, at Trenos footpath crossing near Llanharan, Rhondda Cynon Taf, South Wales. The pedestrian had walked onto the crossing, and did not move clear when the train driver repeatedly sounded the train horn and applied the emergency brake. Approximately 20 minutes before the accident, another train had stopped at the crossing when its driver observed the pedestrian walking slowly over the crossing. The guard on this train had a short conversation with the pedestrian and, because he was concerned about her state of mind, asked his train driver to contact the signaller by radio. The driver\u2019s radio call was answered by a signaller located in Cardiff who relayed the message to a signaller at Port Talbot who was responsible for the Trenos area. As a result, the signaller was asked to stop trains at signals before the crossing and instruct drivers to proceed at caution when approaching the crossing. Based on out-of-date and misleading information shown on his display screen, the Port Talbot signaller put signals to red on either side of a closed crossing about 0.75 miles (1.2 km) from Trenos crossing. Shortly afterwards, he returned these signals to green, so the driver of the train involved in the accident was not cautioned and the train approached the crossing at normal speed. The accident occurred because the pedestrian walked onto the crossing and into the path of an approaching train. However, it is possible that cautioning the train in accordance with railway rules would have avoided the accident. It is possible that the Port Talbot signaller\u2019s decision making was influenced by fatigue. The RAIB has made one recommendation relating to the accuracy of signallers\u2019 displays. It has also identified three learning points. The first relates to the responsibility of staff to both report fatigue to their managers and to arrange their off-duty time so that they have sufficient sleep before the start of a shift. The second refers to the provision of, and familiarity with, up to date reference diagrams needed by signallers, and the third to the importance of signallers recording details about the cautioning of trains."},
{"title": "\n    Report 09/2018: Freight train derailment at Ely West Junction\n  ", "text": "At 14:21 hrs on Monday 14 August 2017, the rear 12 wagons of a freight train carrying containers derailed at Ely West Junction on the line between Ely and March.  The train was travelling at 41 mph (66 km/h) at the time of the derailment.  It ran derailed for approximately 350 metres, causing significant damage to the infrastructure. The first wagon to derail was an FEA-A wagon fitted with Y33 bogies.  The derailment occurred because the damping on the bogies of this wagon was ineffective.  The damping had become ineffective because the damping components, which had been on the wagon since it was built in 2003, had been managed to incorrect maintenance limits.  The limits did not account for future wear in the period before the next maintenance intervention and were also not compatible with the design intent of the damping system.  In addition, the maintenance interventions since a General Repair in 2010 (the last time when these components had been measured) were ineffective in identifying the worn state of the components.  It is also probable that the company responsible for the maintenance of the wagon did not appropriately validate the General Repair maintenance specification used in 2010 to confirm that it would ensure continued safe operation up to the next planned General Repair due in 2017. The fleet of wagons has since gone through General Repair and all of the damping components have been replaced. The RAIB has made one recommendation to the company responsible for the maintenance of the wagons to review its maintenance documentation to ensure that the bogies on its freight wagons remain adequately damped at all times.  In addition, the RAIB has identified three learning points.  The first reminds those responsible for updating maintenance instructions that repair limits quoted in guidelines or by manufacturers should not be used as maintenance limits as this provides no future operational life.  The second learning point reminds Entities in Charge of Maintenance that they should have a validated system of maintenance that ensures that the vehicles for which they are in charge remain safe for operation.  The final learning point reminds maintainers of this type of bogie that some of them are fitted with an inspection window to allow the damping system components to be visually examined."},
{"title": "\n    Report 08/2018: Collision at Stainforth Road level crossing\n  ", "text": "At around 05:50 hrs on 11 January 2018, a car collided with the rear-most wagon of a stationary freight train at Stainforth Road Automatic Half-Barrier level crossing, near Doncaster. The crossing\u2019s warning equipment was not operating and its half- barriers were raised when the car approached and entered the crossing. As a result of the accident, the driver of the car suffered scratches and bruises but their car was damaged beyond economic repair. The train was at a stand because its brakes had been applied by the locomotive\u2019s vigilance device. This occurred because the driver of the train did not respond to the device\u2019s audible alarm in the time period permitted, probably due to the high level of ambient noise in the locomotive\u2019s cab. The car driver was not alerted to the presence of the train by the crossing\u2019s warning devices because the design of the level crossing\u2019s control circuits had permitted it to re-open to road traffic while it was still occupied by the train. The car driver did not see the wagon with enough time to take effective avoiding action, given her speed of approach. This was because the train was unlit and unreflective and also because there was no ambient light near the crossing. The crossing\u2019s control circuits dated back to its original installation in 1974. The control circuits had not been modified to incorporate later features which prove that trains are clear of a crossing before it re-opens. This was because a retrospective modification of this type was not mandated by relevant standards and guidance and also because the crossing\u2019s circuits had not required modification during the life of the crossing for other reasons. The crossing had not been renewed or replaced prior to the accident, because Network Rail had assessed it as still having useful working life left. The level crossing risk assessment process used by Network Rail did not identify and address the risk of the original design of control circuit remaining in service without it having later design features intended to improve safety. The RAIB has made two recommendations, both addressed to Network Rail. The first recommendation relates to an assessment of the risk at other level crossings where there is the possibility of it re-opening to road users with a train still present on the crossing and the development and implementation of mitigation measures, where appropriate, to address this risk. The second recommendation concerns the revision of the current standard relating to the design of new remotely monitored level crossings so that this requires them not to open to road users while a train is present."},
{"title": "\n    Report 08/2017: Near miss at Dock Lane level crossing\n  ", "text": "At about 13:25 hrs on Tuesday 14 June 2016, the passenger of a car that was waiting to cross the line was opening the gates at Dock Lane user worked crossing, in Melton, Suffolk, when a train passed over the crossing. The signaller at Saxmundham signal box had given permission for the car to cross the line after the car driver had contacted him using the telephone provided at the crossing. The signaller knew the train\u2019s approximate location before the call and was aware of its proximity to Dock Lane user worked crossing. However, during the call he did not use this information to decide to refuse permission to cross. Immediately after the call, the signaller realised the error. It is possible that the signaller gave an automatic response to the car driver, partly because of the familiar nature of the telephone call and partly because of mental fatigue resulting from the complexity of maintaining awareness of train locations with the limited information that was available to him. Also, because he had been provided with all the information he needed to handle such a call without asking for it, he did not take the lead in the conversation. Had he done so, it might have reduced the chance of such an error. The signaller at Saxmundham signal box is responsible for managing a high number of crossing telephone calls. The volume was such that it was highly likely that he would eventually make an error that could lead to a near miss or an accident. The RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail, addressing management of human error when assessing level crossing risk, assessment of the signaller\u2019s workload at Saxmundham, identification and assessment of other signalling locations with a high workload from level crossings, and the criteria for triggering assessment of workload demands on signallers. Response to recommendations: RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses."},
{"title": "\n    Report 10/2017: Landslip and derailment at Loch Eilt\n  ", "text": "Before dawn on Monday 22 January 2018, a passenger train travelling between Mallaig and Fort William in north-west Scotland struck a large landslip on a remote section of line near Glenfinnan. The leading coach of the 2-car train derailed to the left and came to a halt embedded in landslip debris. There were no injuries, but some diesel fuel escaped from the damaged train and was carried by flowing water into a lineside drainage channel. Due to the inaccessibility of the site, pollution control measures were not put in place until later the following day, and by this time some diesel fuel had entered nearby Loch Eilt. The landslip originated from a natural hillside above the railway and was triggered by a combination of rainfall and snow melting during a rapid thaw. The ground may have been saturated before it froze. A protective fence, which had previously been installed near the railway to trap falling rocks was overwhelmed by the event. The RAIB found that Network Rail\u2019s processes for managing landslip risk did not take account of the hazard caused by rapidly melting snow. It is unlikely that a greater understanding of snowmelt risk would have avoided the accident at Loch Eilt, but it could avoid or mitigate an accident in other circumstances. The RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail to promote the development of weather forecasting processes to take account of risk due to snowmelt and ground thaw. The RAIB has also made one learning point concerning the importance of having effective and verified arrangements in place for responding to environmental emergencies in remote and inaccessible areas."},

A high speed passenger train was approaching the level crossing on the Down Main line at the maximum permitted line speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), when the driver saw a group of track workers in the distance.  He sounded the train\u2019s warning horn, but saw no response from the group.  A few seconds later the driver gave a series of short blasts on the train horn as it approached, and passed, the track workers. The track workers became aware of the train about three seconds before it reached them.  One of the group shouted a warning to three others who were between the running rails of the Down Main line.  These three workers cleared the track about one second before the train passed them.  During this time the driver had continued to sound the horn and made an emergency brake application before the train passed the point where the group had been working, thinking his train might strike one or more of them.  The train subsequently came to a stand around 0.75 miles (1.2 km) after passing the site of work. The immediate cause of the near miss was that the track workers did not move to a position of safety as the train approached.  The group had been working under an unsafe and unofficial system of work, set up by the Person in Charge ( ).  Instead of adhering to the correct method of using the Train Operated Warning System ( ) by moving his team to, and remaining in, a position of safety while   was warning of an approaching train, the   used the audible warning as a cue for the lookout to start looking out for approaching trains in order to maximise the working time of the group on the track.

{"title": "\n    Report 12/2018: Collision at Frognal Farm User Worked Crossing\n  ", "text": "On 23 October 2017, a passenger train collided with a parcel delivery van at Frognal Farm user worked level crossing, near Teynham, in Kent. The train was travelling at 89 mph (143 km/h). It did not derail, and no-one on the train was hurt, but the train was damaged by the impact. The van was severely damaged and the van driver suffered serious injuries. The van driver was delivering a parcel to a property on the far side of the crossing. He initially went to an incorrect address, where he was given directions which involved going over the crossing to reach the correct address. The level crossing was equipped with power-operated gates, controlled by a button at the side of the approach road, and a telephone which vehicle drivers were required to use to contact the signaller to obtain permission to cross. Being unfamiliar with user worked crossings, the van driver did not notice the telephone and pressed the button to operate the gates. They opened, and so he returned to his van to drive across the crossing, believing it was safe to cross. There were multiple signs associated with the crossing which were placed in a way that meant they did not stand out to the van driver. The van driver had been told that he needed to press a green button to open the gates at the crossing, and he was focused on locating this button. The fact that the gate opened when the button was pressed, coupled with the van driver\u2019s previous experience of other types of level crossing, may have reinforced his view that it was safe to cross. The RAIB has found that an underlying cause of the accident was that the system where authorised users are responsible for briefing visitors about the safe way to use private crossings, is unreasonable in present-day circumstances. The RAIB has made four recommendations, the first directed to Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road to improve the signage at private crossings and review the concept of authorised users. The second is directed to the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road to change the law covering the signage at private crossings. The third is to Network Rail, to improve the safety of private crossings equipped with power operated gate opening equipment. The last is also directed to Network Rail, to review the way in which it collects and maintains data about regular users of private crossings, so that it can better communicate important information about crossing safety."},
{"title": "\n    Report 15/2018: Pushchair trapped in tram doors and dragged, Nottingham\n  ", "text": "At around 13:29 hrs on 15 December 2017, an empty pushchair became trapped on the outside of a tram at Radford Road tram stop, Nottingham, when its plastic rain cover was caught between closing doors. It was then dragged to the next tram stop where it was crushed against the kerb. Nobody was physically injured. A passenger had pushed the pushchair off the tram as the doors were closing because she wished to remain with another passenger who had been removed from the tram by a Nottingham Trams\u2019 travel officer. The rain cover was too thin to trigger the system which automatically reopens the doors if an obstacle is detected. The final visual door check, which drivers are required to carry out before departing from a tram stop, did not result in the driver being aware that the pushchair, shown as a small object on a CCTV monitor in his cab, was in an unsafe position. A larger image of the pushchair was not available to the driver when doing this check because of a modification to the tram\u2019s CCTV system. The travel officer and other staff at the tram stop were unable to stop the tram departing, and the tram driver remained unaware of the pushchair until he arrived at the next tram stop. Inadequate risk assessment by Nottingham Trams is the probable underlying cause for its staff placing inappropriate reliance on the doors closed indication, being unaware of the importance of the final door visual check, and the way in which the tram CCTV arrangements were modified. The incident also showed that training of travel officers was inadequate. The RAIB investigation has resulted in two recommendations, both addressed to Nottingham Trams, and one learning point. The first recommendation seeks improved arrangements for preventing trap and drag events. The second requires improvements to Nottingham Trams\u2019 risk assessment processes.  The learning point reminds all tram drivers that they must carry out a thorough final door visual check, and not rely solely on doors closed indications, when deciding whether it is safe for their tram to depart."},
{"title": "\n    Report 17/2018: Extensive track damage between Ferryside and Llangennech\n  ", "text": "On 30 October 2017, train 6B13, which was carrying oil-based products from Robeston oil terminal, Milford Haven, to Westerleigh oil terminal, Bristol, caused extensive damage to railway infrastructure over approximately 25 miles (40 km). After the train had been stopped, at the entrance to Llangyfelach Tunnel near Swansea, the driver found that there had been a catastrophic failure of the braking system on one of the fully laden wagons. The investigation found that one of the wheelsets on the damaged wagon had locked up and slid, causing severe wheel flats, before starting to rotate again. Impacts from the wheel flats subsequently damaged the rails as well as equipment mounted on the bogie, some of which partially detached and was dragged under the train, causing damage to track-mounted equipment. The wheelset had locked up and then started rotating again because an object became caught between one of the wheels and the adjacent brake block holder. This was most likely to have been one of the brake blocks, which had fallen off the wagon during the journey of train 6B13, probably due to the omission of key components when the brake blocks were replaced on 27 October. The RAIB has made one recommendation to Touax Rail and other affected parties regarding a risk assessment of the facilities and processes used for maintaining wagons operating out of Robeston terminal. The RAIB has also identified three learning points about checking the security of brake blocks before permitting a vehicle to re-enter traffic, the application of general signalling regulation 19, and signallers and control staff being aware of the potential consequences of an incident involving a train carrying dangerous goods."},
{"title": "\n    Report 16/2018: Detrainment onto live track near Peckham Rye\n  ", "text": "At 18:46 hrs on Tuesday 7 November 2017, a London Overground service from Dalston Junction to Battersea Park, operated by Arriva Rail London, came to a stand shortly before reaching Peckham Rye station. A faulty component on the train had caused the brakes to apply, and the driver was unable to release them. There were about 450 passengers on the train. The train driver spoke over the railway radio system to the service controller, train technicians, and the signaller. Following these conversations he began, with the assistance of a member of staff from Peckham Rye station, to evacuate the passengers from the train via the door at the right-hand side of the driver\u2019s cab at the front of the train. This involved passengers climbing down vertical steps to ground level, very close to the live electric conductor rail (third rail) and walking along the side of the line for about 30 metres to Peckham Rye station. Soon afterwards, an operations manager from Govia Thameslink Rail, which manages Peckham Rye station, contacted the member of station staff and realised where they were and what was happening. The operations manager immediately instructed the driver to stop the evacuation, and requested that he contact the signaller and his company\u2019s controller for further instructions. The driver, after further advice from control room based train technicians, isolated various train safety systems, and found that he was eventually able to release the brakes and move the train forward into Peckham Rye station, arriving at about 19:44 hrs. It was then possible for all the remaining passengers to leave the train normally, and it proceeded, empty, to the depot at New Cross Gate. No-one was hurt in the incident. The incident occurred because the driver initiated the detrainment of passengers without the traction current being switched off. He did this because he was given instructions by control room staff who had misunderstood the actual location of the stranded train. The train driver and the signaller did not reach a clear understanding about the actions that were required to safely detrain the passengers. The delay caused unrest among the passengers on the train and contributed to stress and task overload of the driver, which affected his decision making. The driver\u2019s experience and skills did not enable him to cope with these demands, and Network Rail did not effectively implement its own procedures for managing an incident involving a stranded train. Underlying factors were that Arriva Rail London strategic command and Network Rail signalling staff were not adequately prepared to manage the incident, and the railway industry standards and procedures relating to stranded trains place little emphasis on the need for practical training for those involved. The RAIB also observed that there were a number of deficiencies in the training and briefing of staff and in the ARL control room arrangements. The RAIB has made three recommendations, directed to Arriva Rail London and Network Rail, intended to improve the response of the railway industry to train failures and other abnormal events, and has identified three learning points relating to the importance of following the correct procedures when preparing to evacuate passengers from trains, ensuring that communications are properly understood, and passing on the details of incidents promptly and effectively."},
{"title": "\n    Report 14/2018: Passenger trapped and dragged at Notting Hill Gate station\n  ", "text": "At about 16:00 hrs on Wednesday 31 January 2018, a passenger became trapped in the doors of a London Underground train as she attempted to board a westbound Central line service at Notting Hill Gate station while the doors were closing. The train departed and reached a maximum speed of 35 km/h before the emergency brakes were applied and the train stopped. The passenger was dragged for approximately 75 metres along the platform, and about 15 metres further into the tunnel. She suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital, where she was treated for about a month. She has since been steadily recovering. The accident occurred because the passenger\u2019s bag became trapped in the doors as she attempted to board the train, the train\u2019s door control system did not detect the presence of the bag trapped in the doors, and the train operator was not aware of the trapped passenger before initiating the train\u2019s departure. It is likely that the train operator did not perceive the passenger because of a number of interacting factors associated with the nature of his task which caused him to not consciously process the available information. The view on the in-cab CCTV monitor did not adequately assist him to detect that a passenger was trapped in the doors and he relied on other cues to depart rather than making a thorough check of the in-cab CCTV monitor. The investigation identified a probable underlying factor associated with training programmes for train operators, concerning scanning techniques for in-cab CCTV monitors and awareness of the limitations of door-traction interlocks. The RAIB has made five recommendations and one learning point, all addressed to London Underground. The recommendations concern the detection of objects by the train\u2019s door systems, how the design of the task, equipment and training can influence train operators\u2019 attention and awareness, and the use of emergency stop facilities on platforms. While there is no evidence that the train operator was impaired by drugs or alcohol, the learning point concerns the importance of following procedures for drug and alcohol testing where relevant."},

The train was travelling at around 65km/h at the time. The track workers managed to move clear of the train two seconds before the train passed them. Neither was injured. The incident occurred because the track workers were unaware of the train approaching on the line which they were on. A second train, on an adjacent line, had blocked their view of the approaching train. Although two trains passing each other in such a manner is a regular event at Pelaw North Junction, the system of work which had been set up by the track workers did not take the blocking of a lookout\u2019s view of one train by another into account. The RAIB found that Nexus Rail\u2019s procedures did not assist with the creation of an effective safe system of work. Additionally, there was a non-compliance with the rule book relating to the lookout not providing a warning when the sighting of trains became obscured. As a result of its investigation, the RAIB has made five recommendations to Nexus Rail. These cover: The RAIB has also identified three learning points. One is a reminder to all track workers on the Tyne and Wear Metro of the rule book requirement to stand in a position of safety when a train is passing on another line. The second reminds lookouts to constantly review their sighting of trains and provide a warning to track workers if sighting is lost for any reason.

The trolley derailed when it struck a wooden level crossing gate.  The gate was pushed into a road which was open to road traffic. There were no injuries, although the level crossing gate was damaged. The immediate cause of the runaway was that the trolley was not fitted with any brakes and was deployed on a gradient without the introduction of any mitigation or safeguard against it running away. The unbraked trolley was almost certainly available for use because it had been donated to the East Lancashire Railway, which did not have any processes in place to manage donations, and no controls in place for use of trolleys during track maintenance.  Additionally, there were no constraints on the use of such trolleys on the railway, nor any competence and training requirements for their operators. There was no assessment of the risks of using the trolley, either generically or for the specific task on the day, and there was no formal training or briefing of the operators on the day. The underlying factors were inadequate management systems in the Permanent Way department and, probably, a lack of Safety Management System compliance audits. The RAIB has made three recommendations as a result of this investigation.  The first is made to the Heritage Railway Association and relates to it issuing guidance to its members on limiting the use of trolleys not fitted with fail-safe brakes, and fully assessing the risks where they are to be used.  The other two are made to East Lancashire Railway; the first relates to the provision of suitable working procedures in the Permanent Way department, and the other to the implementation of an effective audit process. The RAIB has also identified three learning points.  These relate to the importance of undertaking planned audit and compliance activities; being clear about how vehicles and trolleys are to be controlled before they are deployed; and considering the safety risks associated with assets that are acquired through donations."},
{"title": "\n    Report 19/2018: Collision at London Waterloo\n  ", "text": "At around 05:42 hrs on Tuesday 15 August 2017, a passenger train was leaving London Waterloo station when it collided with a stationary engineering train at a speed of 13 mph (21 km/h). No injuries were reported but both trains were damaged and there was serious disruption to train services until the middle of the following day. The passenger train was diverted away from its intended route by a set of points which were positioned incorrectly as a result of uncontrolled wiring added to the signalling system. This wiring was added to overcome a problem that was encountered while testing signalling system modifications which were being made as part of a project to increase station capacity. The problem arose because the test equipment design process had not allowed for alterations being made to the signalling system after the test equipment was designed. The actions of a functional tester were inconsistent with the competence expected of testers. As a consequence, the uncontrolled wiring was added without the safeguards required by Network Rail signalling works testing standards, and remained in place when the line was returned to service. A project decision to secure the points in the correct position had not been implemented. An underlying factor was that competence management processes operated by Network Rail and some of its contractors had not addressed the full requirements of the roles undertaken by the staff responsible for the design, testing and commissioning of the signalling works. The RAIB has observed that there are certain similarities between the factors that caused the Waterloo accident and those which led to the serious accident at Clapham Junction in 1988. The RAIB has therefore expressed the concern that some of the lessons identified by the public inquiry, chaired by Anthony Hidden QC following Clapham, may be fading from the railway industry\u2019s collective memory. As a result of the investigation, the RAIB has made three recommendations. The first, addressed to Network Rail, seeks improvements in the depth of knowledge and the attitudes needed for signal designers, installers and testers to deliver work safely. Recommendations addressed to OSL Rail Ltd and Mott MacDonald Ltd seek development and monitoring of non-technical skills among the staff working for them. The RAIB has also identified four learning points. One highlights the positive aspects of a plan intended to mitigate an unusually high risk of points being moved unintentionally. The others reinforce the need to follow established procedures, prompt staff to clearly allocate duties associated with unusual activities and remind staff that up-to-date signalling documentation must be available and easily identified in relay rooms and similar locations."}
